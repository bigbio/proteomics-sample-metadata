== Introduction to [Use Case Name]

[Provide a brief introduction to the specific proteomics technique or experiment type. Explain its importance, applications, and any unique challenges it presents for data annotation.]

== Additional Required Columns for [Use Case Name]

In addition to the standard SDRF-Proteomics columns, [use case name] experiments require the following specific columns:

=== Sample Characteristics

* *characteristics[required_field_1]*: This column is MANDATORY for [use case name] experiments. It describes [explanation of what this field captures]. Common values include:
** [Example value 1]
** [Example value 2]
** [Example value 3]

* *characteristics[required_field_2]*: This column is MANDATORY for [use case name] experiments. It provides [explanation of what this field captures]. This is crucial for [explain why this field is important].

=== Optional Recommended Columns

* *characteristics[optional_field_1]*: This column is RECOMMENDED to specify [explanation of what this field captures]. Common values include [provide examples].

* *characteristics[optional_field_2]*: This column is RECOMMENDED to specify [explanation of what this field captures]. This information is particularly important for [explain why this field is useful].

* *comment[optional_comment_1]*: This column is RECOMMENDED to specify [explanation of what this comment captures]. This might include [provide examples or context].

== Example SDRF-[Use Case Name] File

The example file `sdrf-[use-case-name].sdrf.tsv` provides a template for annotating [use case name] experiments. It includes the minimum required columns as well as the additional columns specific to [use case name].
