== SDRF-Proteomics use cases representation (templates)

The SDRF **Templates** are a set of ready-to-use SDRF templates to annotate the different types of proteomics experiments (use cases) to ensure that Minimum Metadata and characteristics are provided to understand the dataset. These templates respond to the distribution and frequency of experiment types in public databases like PRIDE and ProteomeXchange. The Python/Java validators will check the column checklists depending on the template.

NOTE: It is planned that, unlike in other PSI formats, regular updates will need to be done to be able to explain how new use cases for the format can be accommodated.

=== Main SDRF Templates

- **Default proteomics experiment**: Minimum information for any proteomics experiment link:sdrf-default.sdrf.tsv[Template]
- **Human experiment**: All tissue-based experiments that use Human samples link:sdrf-human.sdrf.tsv[Template]
- **Vertebrates experiment**: Vertebrate experiment. link:sdrf-vertebrates.sdrf.tsv[Template]
- **Invertebrates experiment**: Invertebrate experiment. link:sdrf-invertebrates.sdrf.tsv[Template]
- **Plants experiment**: Plant experiment. link:sdrf-plants.sdrf.tsv[Template]
- **Cell lines experiment**: Experiments using cell-lines. link:sdrf-cell-line.sdrf.tsv[Template]
=== Specific Use Case Templates

- **Immunopeptidomics experiment**: Experiments focusing on MHC-bound peptides. link:../immunopeptidomics/sdrf-immunopeptidomics.sdrf.tsv[Template]
- **Single Cell Proteomics experiment**: Experiments analyzing individual cells. link:../single-cell/sdrf-single-cell.sdrf.tsv[Template]
- **Crosslinking Proteomics experiment**: Experiments using crosslinking reagents to study protein-protein interactions. link:../crosslinking/sdrf-crosslinking.sdrf.tsv[Template]

NOTE: Each of the templates is a tsv file with the minimum columns to describe the experiment. The community can create its own templates, for example, for meta-proteomics experiments, imaging proteomics or top-down. If the community would like to add a new template, the following table should be modified and the corresponding tsv should be created in this folder.

*Sample attributes*: Minimum sample attributes for primary cells from different species and cell lines
