[[status]]
== Status of this Template

This document provides guidelines for annotating cell line-based proteomics experiments in SDRF-Proteomics format. This template extends the core SDRF-Proteomics specification with cell line-specific metadata fields and resources.

**Version 1.0.0** - 2025-01

[[abstract]]
== Abstract

Cell lines are extensively used in proteomics research, both for biological studies and for technology/method development. Cell lines present unique annotation challenges because:

- They have well-defined characteristics that can be retrieved from databases
- Metadata like sex, age, and disease refer to the original donor, not the cell line passage
- Multiple databases and ontologies exist for cell line identification
- Cell lines may be misidentified, contaminated, or have undergone genetic drift

This template defines standardized approaches for annotating cell line experiments, including the use of Cellosaurus as the primary resource for cell line identification and metadata.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation

Cell line annotation in proteomics datasets has historically been inconsistent:

1. **Multiple naming conventions**: HeLa, HELA, He-La may all refer to the same cell line
2. **Outdated ontologies**: The Cell Line Ontology (CLO) has not been actively maintained
3. **Missing metadata**: Key information about donor characteristics is often omitted
4. **No standard identifiers**: Lack of consistent accession numbers for cell lines

This template addresses these issues by:

- Recommending Cellosaurus as the primary cell line resource
- Providing a curated database of cell line metadata for SDRF annotation
- Defining which metadata fields should be populated from databases vs. experiment-specific annotation

[[cellosaurus]]
== Cellosaurus: The Primary Cell Line Resource

https://www.cellosaurus.org/[Cellosaurus] is a comprehensive knowledge resource on cell lines maintained by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. It provides:

- Standardized cell line names
- Unique accession numbers (CVCL_XXXX format)
- Cross-references to other databases
- Information about species, diseases, and cell types
- Documentation of cell line problems (contamination, misidentification)

IMPORTANT: While Cellosaurus is not a formal ontology, it is the most comprehensive and actively maintained resource for cell line information. SDRF-Proteomics RECOMMENDS using Cellosaurus accession numbers for cell line identification.

=== Cellosaurus Accession Format

Cellosaurus accessions follow the format `CVCL_XXXX` where XXXX is a unique identifier:

|===
|Cell Line |Cellosaurus Name |Cellosaurus Accession

|HeLa
|HeLa
|CVCL_0030

|HEK293
|HEK293
|CVCL_0045

|K562
|K-562
|CVCL_0004

|Jurkat
|Jurkat
|CVCL_0065

|MCF7
|MCF7
|CVCL_0031

|A549

[[cell-line-metadata-db]]
== SDRF Cell Line Metadata Database

To facilitate consistent annotation of cell line experiments, a curated database of cell line metadata is available:

https://github.com/bigbio/sdrf-cellline-metadata-db[SDRF Cell Line Metadata Database]

The database file is available at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbio/sdrf-cellline-metadata-db/main/cl-annotations-db.tsv

=== Using the Database

When annotating cell line experiments:

1. Look up your cell line in the database
2. Copy the relevant metadata fields to your SDRF file
3. Add experiment-specific annotations (treatment, passage number, etc.)

Example workflow:
[source,bash]
----
# Download the database
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbio/sdrf-cellline-metadata-db/main/cl-annotations-db.tsv

# Search for your cell line
grep -i "HeLa" cl-annotations-db.tsv
----

[[metadata-sources]]
== Understanding Metadata Sources

Cell line metadata comes from two sources:

=== Database-Derived Metadata

These fields describe the original cell line and SHOULD be obtained from Cellosaurus or the SDRF Cell Line Metadata Database:

- `characteristics[organism]` - Species
- `characteristics[organism part]` - Tissue of origin
- `characteristics[disease]` - Disease of original tissue
- `characteristics[sex]` - Sex of donor
- `characteristics[age]` - Age of donor
- `characteristics[cell type]` - Cell type
- `characteristics[ancestry category]` - Donor ancestry
- `characteristics[developmental stage]` - Donor developmental stage
- `characteristics[cellosaurus accession]` - Identifier
- `characteristics[sampling site]` - Anatomical location

IMPORTANT: For database-derived fields, use the values from the cell line database, NOT values specific to your experiment. For example, `characteristics[age]` should be the age of the original donor (e.g., "31Y" for HeLa), not the "age" of your cell culture.

=== Experiment-Specific Metadata

These fields describe your specific experiment and SHOULD be provided by the user:

- `comment[passage number]` - Your passage number
- `comment[cell line source]` - Where you obtained cells
- `comment[authentication method]` - Your authentication
- `comment[mycoplasma status]` - Your testing results
- `comment[culture conditions]` - Your culture conditions
- `comment[cell line modifications]` - Any modifications made
- `characteristics[treatment]` - Experimental treatments
- `characteristics[compound]` - Drugs/compounds applied

[[ontology-mapping]]
== Ontology Mapping

While Cellosaurus is the RECOMMENDED primary resource, SDRF-Proteomics also accepts terms from:

|===
|Resource |Use Case |Example

|Cellosaurus
|Primary cell line identification (RECOMMENDED)
|CVCL_0030

|BTO (BRENDA Tissue Ontology)
|Alternative ontology terms
|BTO:0000567

|CLO (Cell Line Ontology)
|Legacy support (not actively maintained)
|CLO:0003684

|EFO (Experimental Factor Ontology)
|General experimental factors
|EFO:0001185
|===

When multiple identifiers are available, we RECOMMEND including at minimum:
1. `characteristics[cell line]` - Common name
2. `characteristics[cellosaurus accession]` - Cellosaurus ID

[[cell-line-issues]]
== Common Cell Line Issues

=== Misidentified Cell Lines

Some cell lines have known issues with misidentification or contamination. Cellosaurus documents these problems. When using cell lines with known issues:

1. Check Cellosaurus for any documented problems
2. Document your authentication method in `comment[authentication method]`
3. Consider noting issues in `comment[cell line notes]`

=== Cell Line Variants and Sublines

For cell line variants or sublines:

|===
|Parent Cell Line |Variant |How to Annotate

|HeLa
|HeLa S3
|Use specific Cellosaurus accession (CVCL_0058)

|HEK293
|HEK293T
|Use HEK293T accession (CVCL_0063)

|Jurkat
|Jurkat E6-1
|Use Jurkat E6-1 accession (CVCL_0367)
|===

Always use the most specific Cellosaurus accession for your cell line variant.

=== Cell Lines with Unknown Donor Information

For cell lines where donor information is unknown:

- Use `not available` for unknown fields (age, sex, ancestry)
- Do NOT leave cells empty
- Document what is known from Cellosaurus

[[best-practices]]
== Best Practices

1. **Use Cellosaurus accessions**: Always include `characteristics[cellosaurus accession]` when available.

2. **Retrieve metadata from databases**: Use the SDRF Cell Line Metadata Database for consistent annotation.

3. **Document passage number**: Include `comment[passage number]` for reproducibility.

4. **Verify cell line identity**: Document authentication in `comment[authentication method]`.

5. **Use official names**: Prefer Cellosaurus names over informal abbreviations.

6. **Separate database vs. experiment metadata**: Understand which fields come from databases vs. your experiment.

7. **Check for known issues**: Review Cellosaurus for contamination or misidentification reports.

8. **Include source information**: Document where cells were obtained with `comment[cell line source]`.

[[template-file]]
== Template File

The cell line SDRF template file is available in this directory:

- link:cell-lines-template.sdrf.tsv[cell-lines-template.sdrf.tsv]

[[validation]]
== Validation

Cell line SDRF files should be validated using the sdrf-pipelines tool:

[source,bash]
----
pip install sdrf-pipelines
parse_sdrf validate-sdrf --sdrf_file your_file.sdrf.tsv
----
