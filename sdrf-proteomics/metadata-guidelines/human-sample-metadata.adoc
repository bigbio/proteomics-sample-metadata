[[status]]
== Status of this Guideline

This document provides guidelines for annotating human-specific metadata in SDRF-Proteomics format. These guidelines apply to all human samples, including both clinical studies and healthy individuals.

**Version 1.0.0** - 2025-01

[[abstract]]
== Abstract

Human-specific metadata is crucial for interpreting proteomics data from human samples, enabling stratification by clinical and demographic characteristics and integration with other biomedical datasets. This guideline defines standardized approaches for annotating human-specific metadata:

- Disease staging and grading
- Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
- Treatment and medication history
- Individual/patient identifiers
- Additional clinical metadata (BMI, lifestyle factors, reproductive status)

For general sample metadata guidelines (age, biological sex, basic disease annotation) that apply to all organisms, see link:sample-metadata.adoc[Sample Metadata Guidelines].

[[disease-staging]]
== Disease Staging and Grading

Disease staging and grading are primarily used for human cancers and other progressive diseases.

[[best-practices]]
== Best Practices

1. **Protect privacy**: Never include identifiable patient information.

2. **Use ontology terms**: Prefer MONDO for diseases, NCIT for staging and treatments.

3. **Be consistent**: Use the same format for all samples in a dataset.

4. **Document unknowns**: Use `not available` rather than leaving cells empty.

5. **Distinguish primary from secondary**: Clearly separate the disease under study from comorbidities.

6. **Include temporal context**: Specify when measurements were taken relative to treatment.

7. **Use standard staging**: Prefer TNM staging for solid tumors when available.

8. **Consider regulatory requirements**: Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations.
