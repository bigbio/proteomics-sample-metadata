= SDRF-Proteomics: Metadata Guidelines
:sectnums:

:doctype: book

== Introduction

This directory contains metadata guidelines that define standardized approaches for annotating specific types of metadata fields in SDRF-Proteomics files. Unlike templates (which define columns for specific experiment types), metadata guidelines provide detailed guidance for annotating particular categories of information that may appear across many different experiment types.

== Available Metadata Guidelines

=== Data Analysis Metadata

Defines standardized parameters for capturing computational analysis settings in SDRF-Proteomics files, enabling reproducible data analysis.

* link:data-analysis-metadata.adoc[Data Analysis Metadata]

Covers:

* Peptide and protein identification parameters
* Quantification parameters
* Statistical testing parameters

=== Sample Metadata

Provides guidelines for general sample metadata that applies to all organisms (human, animal, plant).

* link:sample-metadata.adoc[Sample Metadata]

Covers:

* Age annotation (format, ranges, categories)
* Biological sex annotation
* Disease and health status annotation
* Developmental stage for model organisms

=== Human Sample Metadata

Provides guidelines for human-specific metadata, applicable to both clinical studies and healthy individuals.

* link:human-sample-metadata.adoc[Human Sample Metadata]

Covers:

* Disease staging and grading (TNM, tumor grade)
* Pre-existing conditions and comorbidities
* Treatment and medication history
* Individual identifiers
* Demographics (ancestry, ethnicity)
* Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, diet)
* Reproductive status

=== Data File Metadata

Provides guidelines for data file metadata including MS run properties, instrument settings, and analysis parameters.

* link:data-file-metadata.adoc[Data File Metadata]

Covers:

* Assay name and data file identification
* Label annotations (TMT, SILAC, iTRAQ, label-free)
* Instrument type and model
* Technology type
* Protein modifications
* Cleavage agents
* Mass tolerances

== Relationship to Core Specification

Annotation guidelines complement the core SDRF-Proteomics specification by providing:

1. **Detailed formatting rules**: How specific values should be formatted (e.g., age as "45Y")
2. **Controlled vocabularies**: Recommended terms and ontologies for specific fields
3. **Best practices**: Guidelines for handling edge cases and special situations
4. **Examples**: Concrete examples of properly annotated metadata

== Adding New Metadata Guidelines

To propose a new metadata guideline:

1. Create an issue on the GitHub repository describing the metadata category and the need for standardization
2. Develop a draft guideline following the structure of existing guidelines
3. Create a pull request against the `dev` branch

New metadata guidelines should address:

* Common annotation challenges
* Inconsistent practices across datasets
* Integration with external standards or databases

== Versioning

Annotation guidelines follow the patch-level versioning:

* Patch release (X.Y.Z → X.Y.Z+1): Refinements to metadata guidelines

Significant additions or changes to metadata guidelines may warrant a minor version increment.
