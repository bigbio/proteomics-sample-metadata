== Introduction

This document provides guidelines for annotating general sample metadata in SDRF-Proteomics format. These guidelines apply to samples from any organism (human, animal, plant, microorganism).

For human-specific metadata (disease staging, comorbidities, treatment history), see link:../templates/human/README.adoc[Human Sample Metadata Guidelines].

**Version 1.1.0** - 2026-01

== Best Practices

1. **Use lowercase** for all controlled vocabulary values (except proper nouns in disease names).
2. **Use ontology terms** mapped to MONDO (diseases), CL (cell types), UBERON (anatomy), PATO (phenotypes).
3. **Be consistent** with format across all samples in a dataset.
4. **Document unknowns** using `not available` (unknown) or `not applicable` (not relevant) - never leave cells empty.
5. **Validate before submission** using sdrf-pipelines to check ontology mappings.

== General Formatting Conventions

=== Capitalization Rules

Most controlled vocabulary values should be **lowercase**:

- Organism names: `homo sapiens`, `mus musculus`
- Organism parts: `blood`, `liver`, `brain`
- Sex values: `male`, `female`
- Developmental stages: `adult`, `embryonic`
- Disease names (general): `breast carcinoma`, `type 2 diabetes mellitus`

**Exceptions** (retain proper noun capitalization):

- Disease names with proper nouns: `Alzheimer disease`, `Parkinson disease`
- Ancestry categories (geographic populations): `African`, `European`, `South Asian`
- Cell line names: `HeLa`, `HEK293`, `K562`

NOTE: Validators should normalize common capitalization variations (e.g., accept both `Homo sapiens` and `homo sapiens`), but submitters should use lowercase for consistency.

=== Reserved Values

The following reserved values can be used across multiple columns when specific data is unavailable:

|===
|Value |When to Use |Example Columns

|`not available`
|Information was not collected or is unknown
|age, sex, ancestry category, disease

|`not applicable`
|The field does not apply to this sample type
|organism part (for cell lines), cell type (for whole organism)

|`anonymized`
|Information exists but has been intentionally redacted for privacy protection (e.g., in clinical studies with de-identified patient data)
|age, sex, individual, ancestry category

|`pooled`
|Sample is pooled from multiple sources with different values
|biological replicate, age, sex
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use `anonymized` when the data exists but cannot be shared due to privacy requirements. This is distinct from `not available` (data was never collected) and provides important context for data reuse. For example, a clinical study may have patient ages recorded internally but publish the data with `anonymized` ages to protect patient identity.
====

== Organism

**Column:** `characteristics[organism]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ncbitaxon[NCBI Taxonomy (NCBITaxon)]

Use the scientific name in lowercase. The validator will map to the correct ontology term.

== Organism Part / Tissue

**Column:** `characteristics[organism part]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon[UBERON] for mammals/vertebrates, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/po[Plant Ontology (PO)] for plants, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/fbbt[FlyBase Anatomy (FBbt)] for Drosophila.

Use lowercase for all values. For cell line samples, use `not applicable` or specify the tissue of origin (e.g., `cervix` for HeLa).

[NOTE]
====
**Do NOT use `characteristics[tissue]`** - Use `characteristics[organism part]` instead.

The `characteristics[tissue]` column should not be used as a replacement for `characteristics[organism part]`. When tissue-related columns are needed, they should be used alongside `characteristics[organism part]` for additional categorization (e.g., `characteristics[tissue supergroup]` for higher-level grouping).

Always use `characteristics[organism part]` for specifying anatomical location or tissue type. Do not use `characteristics[tissue]` as a replacement.

[[age-annotation]]
== Age

**Column:** `characteristics[age]`

**Format:** `{Number}{Unit}` where Unit is: `Y` (Years), `M` (Months), `W` (Weeks), `D` (Days).

=== Age Formats

|===
|Age Type |Format |Example |Description

|Exact age |`{Number}{Unit}` |`40Y` |40 years old
|Exact age |`{Number}{Unit}` |`8W` |8 weeks old
|Age range |`{Lower}{Unit}-{Upper}{Unit}` |`40Y-50Y` |Between 40 and 50 years
|Greater than |`>{Number}{Unit}` |`>18Y` |Older than 18 years
|Less than |`<{Number}{Unit}` |`<65Y` |Younger than 65 years
|Greater or equal |`>={Number}{Unit}` |`>=21Y` |21 years or older
|===

=== Special Values

|===
|Value |When to Use

|`not available` |Age is unknown or not recorded
|`not applicable` |Age doesn't apply (e.g., immortalized cell lines, pooled samples from different ages)
|`anonymized` |Age has been intentionally redacted for privacy protection
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
**When exact age is unavailable:** If age cannot be determined precisely, consider using:

1. **Age ranges** (e.g., `40Y-50Y`) when approximate age is known
2. **Comparison operators** (e.g., `>18Y`) when only bounds are known
3. **link:#developmental-stage[Developmental stage]** (e.g., `adult`, `juvenile`, `embryonic`) when age is unknown but developmental stage can be inferred from other metadata

The developmental stage column is particularly useful for:

* Animal studies where exact age may not be recorded
* Pooled samples from subjects of different ages
* Historical samples where age records are incomplete
====

[[sex-annotation]]
== Sex

**Column:** `characteristics[sex]`

**Requirement:** REQUIRED for human samples, OPTIONAL for other organisms.

**Allowed values:**

|===
|Value |Description

|male |Male biological sex
|female |Female biological sex
|intersex |Intersex biological sex
|anonymized |Sex has been intentionally redacted for privacy protection
|not available |Sex is unknown or not recorded
|not applicable |Sex doesn't apply (e.g., pooled samples from mixed sexes)
|pooled |Pooled samples from subjects of different sexes
|===

NOTE: Use lowercase values. For cell lines, use the sex of the original donor if known (e.g., `female` for HeLa cells), otherwise use `not available`. Use `anonymized` when the information exists but has been redacted for privacy reasons (e.g., clinical studies with de-identified data).

[[developmental-stage]]
== Developmental Stage

**Column:** `characteristics[developmental stage]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon[UBERON], https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo[EFO]

|===
|Value |Description

|adult |Sexually mature organism
|embryonic |Pre-birth/pre-hatching
|===

For model organisms, use specific stages when applicable: `embryonic day 14` (mouse E14), `24 hpf` (zebrafish 24 hours post fertilization).

[[disease-annotation]]
== Disease

**Column:** `characteristics[disease]`

**Ontology:** https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/[MONDO Disease Ontology] (preferred), https://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/[EFO], https://disease-ontology.org/[Human Disease Ontology (DOID)]

=== Healthy Samples: normal vs healthy vs control

For samples without disease, the terminology matters for standardization:

**`normal`** (PATO:0000461) - **Recommended**

- Standard term in pathology ("normal tissue" vs "tumor tissue")
- Well-defined ontology mapping to PATO:0000461
- Widely used in existing proteomics datasets

**`healthy`** (SIO:001012) - **Accepted alternative**

- More intuitive for clinical/human samples
- Has valid ontology support (Semanticscience Integrated Ontology)
- Validators should accept both `normal` and `healthy`

**`control`** - **Avoid in disease field**

- "Control" is an **experimental design concept**, not a disease state
- Ambiguous: a control could be healthy, vehicle-treated, time-zero, or even a different disease used for comparison
- The experimental role should be captured in `factor value[disease]`, not in `characteristics[disease]`

=== Disease State vs Experimental Role

The `characteristics[disease]` column captures the **actual disease state** of the sample, while `factor value[disease]` indicates the **experimental comparison groups**:

|healthy_1 |... |normal |... |normal
|tumor_1 |... |breast carcinoma |... |breast carcinoma
|adjacent_1 |... |normal |... |normal
|===
endif::[]

In this example:

- `healthy_1`: Healthy control sample from a healthy individual
- `tumor_1`: Disease case sample (tumor tissue)
- `adjacent_1`: Adjacent normal tissue from a cancer patient

Both `healthy_1` and `adjacent_1` have `normal` as their disease state (no tumor cells), but they come from different individuals. The experimental design and comparison groups are defined by the factor values.

NOTE: APP/PS1 and db/db are common mouse disease models for Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes respectively.

[[phenotype-annotation]]
== Phenotype

**Column:** `characteristics[phenotype]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/pato[PATO:0000001], https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebi.ac.uk%252Fefo%252FEFO_0000651[EFO:0000651]

**Requirement:** Optional

Describes observable characteristics or traits of a sample that result from genotype, environment, and treatment interactions. Captures **how the sample behaves or appears**, not what disease it has.

=== Key Distinction: Disease vs Phenotype vs Genotype

Understanding the relationship between these concepts is critical for accurate annotation:

|===
|Column |Purpose |What it captures |Example

|`characteristics[disease]` |Health condition |What disease/pathology is present |"breast cancer", "normal", "Alzheimer disease"
|`characteristics[genotype]` |Genetic variant |What genetic variant is present |"KRAS G12D mutant", "wild type", "APP/PS1 transgenic"
|`characteristics[phenotype]` |Observable trait |How the sample behaves/appears |"gefitinib sensitive", "high fat diet", "stress response"
|===

**Important:** These are complementary, not mutually exclusive:

* A sample can have a **disease** (Alzheimer's) caused by a **genotype** (APP mutation) that results in a **phenotype** (amyloid accumulation)
* A sample can have a **phenotype** (drug resistant) without a known **genotype** cause
* A sample can have a **genotype** (transgenic) without an obvious **phenotype**

=== Phenotype Categories

**1. Drug Response Phenotypes**

Used in pharmacoproteomics to describe drug sensitivity or resistance:

[source]
----
characteristics[phenotype]: gefitinib sensitive
characteristics[phenotype]: cisplatin resistant
characteristics[phenotype]: tamoxifen resistant
characteristics[phenotype]: sensitive to methotrexate
----

**2. Molecular Marker Phenotypes**

Used for biomarker status in precision medicine studies:

[source]
----
characteristics[phenotype]: HER2 positive
characteristics[phenotype]: ER positive
characteristics[phenotype]: ALDH+
characteristics[phenotype]: CD34 positive
----

**3. Expression/Overexpression Phenotypes**

Used to describe gene/protein expression characteristics:

[source]
----
characteristics[phenotype]: overexpressing Neurogenin3
characteristics[phenotype]: FOXP3 expression
characteristics[phenotype]: RPS4 over-expression
----

**4. Functional Phenotypes**

Used for differentiation states and functional traits:

[source]
----
characteristics[phenotype]: undifferentiated
characteristics[phenotype]: adipogenic
characteristics[phenotype]: high protein content
----

**5. Environmental/Treatment Response Phenotypes**

Used for model organism studies with environmental or dietary interventions:

[source]
----
characteristics[phenotype]: high fat diet
characteristics[phenotype]: caloric restriction
characteristics[phenotype]: heat shock response
characteristics[phenotype]: oxidative stress
----

=== Phenotype in Model Organisms

Phenotype is particularly important for model organism studies where the same genotype may produce different phenotypes under different conditions:

|===
|source name |characteristics[organism] |characteristics[genotype] |characteristics[phenotype]

|mouse_hfd_1 |mus musculus |wild type |high fat diet induced obesity
|mouse_ctrl_1 |mus musculus |wild type |normal diet
|zebrafish_hs_1 |danio rerio |hsp70:GFP transgenic |heat shock response
|fly_stress_1 |drosophila melanogaster |wild type |oxidative stress
|===

=== When NOT to Use Phenotype

* ❌ For disease names → Use `characteristics[disease]`
* ❌ For genetic variants → Use `characteristics[genotype]`
* ❌ For treatments applied → Use `characteristics[compound]` or `characteristics[treatment]`
* ❌ For basic sample properties → Use appropriate specific column (age, sex, etc.)

=== Proteomics Use Cases

1. **Pharmacoproteomics:** Compare proteomes of drug-sensitive vs. drug-resistant samples
2. **Precision Medicine:** Stratify samples by biomarker status (HER2+/HER2-, ER+/ER-)
3. **Drug Response Studies:** Identify proteomic signatures of treatment response
4. **Stem Cell Research:** Track proteomic changes during differentiation
5. **Model Organism Studies:** Characterize phenotypic responses to environmental conditions

[[cell-type-annotation]]
== Cell Type

**Column:** `characteristics[cell type]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/cl[Cell Ontology (CL)]

For synthetic libraries, most sample metadata can be `not applicable`. The organism MAY be specified if the library was designed from specific species peptides.

== Material Type

**Column:** `characteristics[material type]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/pride/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FPRIDE_0000837[PRIDE:0000837] (derived from https://www.fged.org/projects/mage-tab/[MAGE-TAB] specification)

Material type describes the nature of the biological material being analyzed. This column originates from the MAGE-TAB specification for transcriptomics and has been adopted for proteomics to enable cross-omics data integration.

**Requirement:** Optional

**Allowed values:**

|===
|Value |Description |When to Use

[[spiked-in-samples]]
== Spiked-in Samples

There are multiple scenarios when a sample is spiked with additional analytes. Peptides, proteins, or mixtures can be added to the sample as controlled amounts to provide a standard or ground truth for quantification, or for retention time alignment, etc.

To include information about the spiked compounds, use _characteristics[spiked compound]_. The information is provided in key-value pairs. Here are the keys and values that SHOULD be provided:

In addition to specifying the component and its quantity, the injected mass of the main sample SHOULD be specified as _characteristics[mass]_.

=== Example: Spiked Peptide

An example of SDRF-Proteomics for a sample spiked with a peptide would be:

[%header,cols="1,2"]
|===
|characteristics[mass] |characteristics[spiked compound]

|1 ug |CT=peptide;PS=PEPTIDESEQ;QY=10 fmol
|===

For multiple spiked components, the column _characteristics[spiked compound]_ may be repeated.

=== Spiked Biological Samples

If the spiked component is another biological sample (e.g. __E. coli__ lysate spiked into human sample), then the spiked component MUST be annotated in its own row. Both components of the sample SHOULD have `characteristics[mass]` specified. Inclusion of _characteristics[spiked compound]_ is optional in this case; if provided, it SHOULD be the string `spiked` for the spiked sample.
