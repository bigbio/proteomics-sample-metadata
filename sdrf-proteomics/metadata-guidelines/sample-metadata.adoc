== Introduction

This document provides guidelines for annotating general sample metadata in SDRF-Proteomics format. These guidelines apply to samples from any organism (human, animal, plant).

For human-specific metadata (disease staging, comorbidities, treatment history), see link:human-sample-metadata.adoc[Human Sample Metadata Guidelines].

**Version 1.0.0** - 2025-01

== Organism

**Column:** `characteristics[organism]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ncbitaxon[NCBI Taxonomy (NCBITaxon)]

Use the scientific name in lowercase. The validator will map to the correct ontology term.

|===
|Value |NCBITaxon ID |Description

|homo sapiens |NCBITaxon:9606 |Human
|mus musculus |NCBITaxon:10090 |Mouse
|===

== Organism Part / Tissue

**Column:** `characteristics[organism part]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon[UBERON] for mammals/vertebrates, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/po[Plant Ontology (PO)] for plants, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/fbbt[FlyBase Anatomy (FBbt)] for Drosophila.

Use lowercase for all values. For cell line samples, use `not applicable` or specify the tissue of origin (e.g., `cervix` for HeLa).

|===
|Value |UBERON ID |Description

|blood |UBERON:0000178 |Whole blood
|liver |UBERON:0002107 |Liver tissue
|===

== Age

**Column:** `characteristics[age]`

**Format:** `{Number}{Unit}` where Unit is: `Y` (Years), `M` (Months), `W` (Weeks), `D` (Days).

For age ranges use: `{LowerBound}{Unit}-{UpperBound}{Unit}` (e.g., `40Y-50Y`).

Use `not available` when age is unknown, `not applicable` for immortalized cell lines.

|===
|Age Description |SDRF Value

|40 years old |40Y
|8 weeks old |8W
|===

== Developmental Stage

**Column:** `characteristics[developmental stage]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon[UBERON], https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo[EFO]

|===
|Value |Description

|adult |Sexually mature organism
|embryonic |Pre-birth/pre-hatching
|===

For model organisms, use specific stages when applicable: `embryonic day 14` (mouse E14), `24 hpf` (zebrafish 24 hours post fertilization).

[[disease-annotation]]
== Disease

**Column:** `characteristics[disease]`

**Ontology:** https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/[MONDO Disease Ontology] (preferred), https://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/[EFO], https://disease-ontology.org/[Human Disease Ontology (DOID)]

=== Healthy Samples: normal vs healthy vs control

For samples without disease, the terminology matters for standardization:

**`normal`** (PATO:0000461) - **Recommended**

- Standard term in pathology ("normal tissue" vs "tumor tissue")
- Well-defined ontology mapping to PATO:0000461
- Widely used in existing proteomics datasets

**`healthy`** (PATO:0001421) - **Accepted alternative**

- More intuitive for clinical/human samples
- Has valid ontology support
- Validators should accept both `normal` and `healthy`

**`control`** - **Avoid in disease field**

- "Control" is an **experimental design concept**, not a disease state
- Ambiguous: a control could be healthy, vehicle-treated, time-zero, or even a different disease used for comparison
- The experimental role should be captured in `factor value[disease]`, not in `characteristics[disease]`

=== Disease State vs Experimental Role

The `characteristics[disease]` column captures the **actual disease state** of the sample, while `factor value[disease]` indicates the **experimental comparison groups**:

|===
|source name |... |characteristics[disease] |... |factor value[disease]

|healthy_1 |... |normal |... |normal
|tumor_1 |... |breast carcinoma |... |breast carcinoma
|adjacent_1 |... |normal |... |normal
|===

In this example:

- `healthy_1`: Healthy control sample from a healthy individual
- `tumor_1`: Disease case sample (tumor tissue)
- `adjacent_1`: Adjacent normal tissue from a cancer patient

Both `healthy_1` and `adjacent_1` have `normal` as their disease state (no tumor cells), but they come from different individuals. The experimental design and comparison groups are defined by the factor values.

=== Disease Examples

|===
|Disease |SDRF Value |Ontology ID

|Healthy/no disease |normal |PATO:0000461
|Healthy (alternative) |healthy |PATO:0001421
|Breast cancer |breast carcinoma |MONDO:0004989
|Alzheimer's disease |Alzheimer disease |MONDO:0004975
|Type 2 diabetes |type 2 diabetes mellitus |MONDO:0005148
|===

=== Animal Disease Models

For animal disease models, use the human disease name to facilitate cross-species comparisons:

|===
|source name |characteristics[organism] |... |characteristics[disease] |...

|APP_PS1_sample1 |mus musculus |... |Alzheimer disease |...
|dbdb_sample1 |mus musculus |... |type 2 diabetes mellitus |...
|wildtype_sample1 |mus musculus |... |normal |...
|===

NOTE: APP/PS1 and db/db are common mouse disease models for Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes respectively.

== Cell Type

**Column:** `characteristics[cell type]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/cl[Cell Ontology (CL)]

For cell lines, optionally include the cell type of origin.

|===
|Value |CL ID

|epithelial cell |CL:0000066
|T cell |CL:0000084
|===

For detailed immune cell studies, use specific subtypes: `CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell` (CL:0000624), `regulatory T cell` (CL:0000815).

== Depletion

**Column:** `characteristics[depletion]`

For blood/plasma samples indicating abundant protein depletion.

Values: `no depletion`, `depletion`, `not applicable`.

== Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX)

**Column:** `characteristics[xenograft]`

When annotating PDX samples, metadata (age, sex) MUST refer to the original patient, not the host organism.

|===
|source name |characteristics[organism] |... |characteristics[xenograft] |characteristics[age] |...

|tumor_001 |homo sapiens |... |not applicable |65Y |...
|pdx_001 |homo sapiens |... |pancreatic adenocarcinoma grown in nude mice |65Y |...
|===

== Synthetic Peptide Libraries

**Column:** `characteristics[synthetic peptide]`

Values: `synthetic` (sample is a synthetic peptide library), `not synthetic` (biological sample).

For synthetic libraries, most sample metadata can be `not applicable`. The organism MAY be specified if the library was designed from specific species peptides.

== PTM Enrichment

**Column:** `characteristics[enrichment process]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo[EFO]

|===
|Value |Description

|enrichment of phosphorylated Protein |Phosphoproteomics enrichment
|not applicable |No PTM enrichment performed
|===

== Best Practices

1. **Use lowercase** for all controlled vocabulary values (except proper nouns in disease names).
2. **Use ontology terms** mapped to MONDO (diseases), CL (cell types), UBERON (anatomy), PATO (phenotypes).
3. **Be consistent** with format across all samples in a dataset.
4. **Document unknowns** using `not available` (unknown) or `not applicable` (not relevant) - never leave cells empty.
5. **Validate before submission** using sdrf-pipelines to check ontology mappings.
