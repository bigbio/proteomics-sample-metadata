== Introduction

This document provides guidelines for annotating general sample metadata in SDRF-Proteomics format. These guidelines apply to samples from any organism (human, animal, plant, microorganism).

For human-specific metadata (disease staging, comorbidities, treatment history), see link:../templates/human/README.adoc[Human Sample Metadata Guidelines].

**Version 1.1.0** - 2026-01

== Best Practices

1. **Use lowercase** for all controlled vocabulary values (except proper nouns in disease names).
2. **Use ontology terms** mapped to MONDO (diseases), CL (cell types), UBERON (anatomy), PATO (phenotypes).
3. **Be consistent** with format across all samples in a dataset.
4. **Document unknowns** using `not available` (unknown) or `not applicable` (not relevant) - never leave cells empty.
5. **Validate before submission** using sdrf-pipelines to check ontology mappings.

== General Formatting Conventions

=== Capitalization Rules

Most controlled vocabulary values are recommended to be **lowercase**:

- Organism names: `homo sapiens`, `mus musculus`
- Organism parts: `blood`, `liver`, `brain`
- Sex values: `male`, `female`

**Exceptions** (retain proper noun capitalization):

- Ancestry categories (geographic populations): `African`, `European`, `South Asian`
- Cell line names: `HeLa`, `HEK293`, `K562`

NOTE: Validators should normalize common capitalization variations (e.g., accept both `Homo sapiens` and `homo sapiens`), but submitters should use lowercase for consistency.

== Organism

**Column:** `characteristics[organism]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ncbitaxon[NCBI Taxonomy (NCBITaxon)]

Use the scientific name in lowercase. The validator will map to the correct ontology term.

|===
|Value |NCBITaxon ID |Description

|homo sapiens |https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ncbitaxon/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FNCBITaxon_9606[NCBITaxon:9606] |Human
|mus musculus |https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ncbitaxon/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FNCBITaxon_10090[NCBITaxon:10090] |Mouse
|===

== Organism Part / Tissue

**Column:** `characteristics[organism part]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon[UBERON] for mammals/vertebrates, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/po[Plant Ontology (PO)] for plants, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/fbbt[FlyBase Anatomy (FBbt)] for Drosophila.

Use lowercase for all values. For cell line samples, use `not applicable` or specify the tissue of origin (e.g., `cervix` for HeLa).

[NOTE]
====
**Do NOT use `characteristics[tissue]`** - Use `characteristics[organism part]` instead.

The `characteristics[tissue]` column should not be used as a replacement for `characteristics[organism part]`. When tissue-related columns are needed, they should be used alongside `characteristics[organism part]` for additional categorization (e.g., `characteristics[tissue supergroup]` for higher-level grouping).
====

|===
|Value |UBERON ID |Description

|blood plasma |https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FUBERON_0001969[UBERON:0001969] |Blood plasma

[[age-annotation]]
== Age

**Column:** `characteristics[age]`

**Format:** `{Number}{Unit}` where Unit is: `Y` (Years), `M` (Months), `W` (Weeks), `D` (Days).

=== Age Formats

|===
|Age Type |Format |Example |Description

|Exact age |`{Number}{Unit}` |`40Y` |40 years old
|Exact age |`{Number}{Unit}` |`8W` |8 weeks old
|Age range |`{Lower}{Unit}-{Upper}{Unit}` |`40Y-50Y` |Between 40 and 50 years
|Greater than |`>{Number}{Unit}` |`>18Y` |Older than 18 years
|Less than |`<{Number}{Unit}` |`<65Y` |Younger than 65 years
|Greater or equal |`>={Number}{Unit}` |`>=21Y` |21 years or older
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
**When exact age is unavailable:** If age cannot be determined precisely, consider using:

1. **Age ranges** (e.g., `40Y-50Y`) when approximate age is known
2. **Comparison operators** (e.g., `>18Y`) when only bounds are known
3. **link:#developmental-stage[Developmental stage]** (e.g., `adult`, `juvenile`, `embryonic`) when age is unknown but developmental stage can be inferred from other metadata

The developmental stage column is particularly useful for:

* Animal studies where exact age may not be recorded
* Pooled samples from subjects of different ages
* Historical samples where age records are incomplete
====

[[sex-annotation]]
== Sex

**Column:** `characteristics[sex]`

**Requirement:** REQUIRED for human samples, OPTIONAL for other organisms. Values allowed are under PATO ontology: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/pato/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FPATO_0000047[PATO:0000047 - Biological Sex] 

**Allowed values:**

|===
|Value |Description

|male |Male biological sex
|female |Female biological sex
|===

NOTE: For cell lines, use the sex of the original donor if known (e.g., `female` for HeLa cells), otherwise use `not available`. Use `anonymized` when the information exists but has been redacted for privacy reasons (e.g., clinical studies with de-identified data).

[[developmental-stage]]
== Developmental Stage

**Column:** `characteristics[developmental stage]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon[UBERON], https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo[EFO]

|===
|Value |Description

|adult |Sexually mature organism
|embryonic |Pre-birth/pre-hatching
|===

For model organisms, use specific stages when applicable: `embryonic day 14` (mouse E14), `24 hpf` (zebrafish 24 hours post fertilization).

[[disease-annotation]]
== Disease

**Column:** `characteristics[disease]`

**Ontology:** https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/[MONDO Disease Ontology] (preferred), https://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/[EFO], https://disease-ontology.org/[Human Disease Ontology (DOID)]

=== Healthy Samples: normal vs healthy vs control

For samples without disease, the terminology matters for standardization:

**`normal`** (PATO:0000461) - **Recommended**

- Standard term in pathology ("normal tissue" vs "tumor tissue")
- Well-defined ontology mapping to PATO:0000461
- Widely used in existing proteomics datasets

**`healthy`** (SIO:001012) - **Accepted alternative**

- More intuitive for clinical/human samples
- Has valid ontology support (Semanticscience Integrated Ontology)
- Validators should accept both `normal` and `healthy`

[[WARNING]]
====
- Avoid using "Control" as a disease state, it is an **experimental design concept**, not a disease state
- Ambiguous: a control could be healthy, vehicle-treated, time-zero, or even a different disease used for comparison
====    

The `characteristics[disease]` column captures the **actual disease state** of the sample, while `factor value[disease]` indicates the **experimental comparison groups**:

|healthy_1 |... |normal |... |normal
|tumor_1 |... |breast carcinoma |... |breast carcinoma
|adjacent_1 |... |normal |... |normal
|===
endif::[]

In this example:

- `healthy_1`: Healthy control sample from a healthy individual
- `tumor_1`: Disease case sample (tumor tissue)
- `adjacent_1`: Adjacent normal tissue from a cancer patient

Both `healthy_1` and `adjacent_1` have `normal` as their disease state (no tumor cells), but they come from different individuals. The experimental design and comparison groups are defined by the factor values.

TIP: For animal disease models, use the human disease name to facilitate cross-species comparisons. 

[[phenotype-annotation]]
== Phenotype

**Column:** `characteristics[phenotype]`

**Ontology:** https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebi.ac.uk%252Fefo%252FEFO_0000651[EFO:0000651]

**Requirement:** Optional

Describes observable characteristics or traits of a sample that result from genotype, environment, and treatment interactions. Captures **how the sample behaves or appears**, not what disease it has.

|===

|`characteristics[disease]` |What disease/pathology is present |"breast cancer", "Alzheimer disease"
|`characteristics[genotype]` |What genetic variant is present |"KRAS G12D mutant", "wild type"
|`characteristics[phenotype]` |How the sample behaves/appears |"gefitinib sensitive", "HER2 positive"
|===

**Common phenotype categories:**

* **Drug response:** gefitinib sensitive, cisplatin resistant
* **Molecular markers:** HER2 positive, ER positive
* **Expression states:** overexpressing Neurogenin3, FOXP3 expression
* **Functional traits:** undifferentiated, adipogenic
* **Environmental responses:** high fat diet, heat shock response
