= SDRF-Proteomics Examples

:doctype: book

== Introduction

This directory contains example SDRF-Proteomics files for various types of proteomics experiments. These examples demonstrate how to apply the SDRF-Proteomics specification in practice and can be used as references when creating your own SDRF files.

== Structure

The examples are organized into two main categories:

=== Core Examples

The `core` directory contains examples of basic SDRF files for different sample types:

* Human samples
* Vertebrate samples
* Invertebrate samples
* Plant samples
* Cell line samples

These examples follow the core SDRF-Proteomics specification and demonstrate how to annotate common types of proteomics experiments.

=== Use Case Examples

The `use-cases` directory contains examples of SDRF files for specific types of proteomics experiments:

* Immunopeptidomics
* Single Cell Proteomics
* Crosslinking Proteomics

These examples demonstrate how to apply the use case specifications, which extend the core specification with additional requirements for specific experiment types.

== How to Use These Examples

1. Find an example that most closely matches your experiment type
2. Use it as a reference when creating your own SDRF file
3. Adapt the example to your specific experiment, ensuring you include all required columns
4. Validate your SDRF file using the sdrf-pipelines tool:
```bash
pip install sdrf-pipelines
parse_sdrf validate-sdrf --sdrf_file your_file.sdrf.tsv
```

== Contributing New Examples

To contribute a new example:

1. Create an SDRF file for your experiment following the appropriate specification
2. Ensure the example includes realistic data that demonstrates the key features of the specification
3. Create a pull request on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/bigbio/proteomics-metadata-standard
