[[status]]
== Status of this Template

This document provides guidelines for annotating affinity-based proteomics experiments in SDRF-Proteomics format. This template extends the core SDRF-Proteomics specification with affinity proteomics-specific metadata fields.

**Version 1.0.0** - 2025-01

[[abstract]]
== Abstract

Affinity proteomics encompasses experimental approaches that use affinity-based capture methods to study specific protein subsets or interactions. Unlike mass spectrometry-based proteomics, these methods typically use antibodies, aptamers, or other affinity reagents to detect and quantify proteins. Major platforms include:

- **Proximity Extension Assay (PEA)**: Olink platform using antibody pairs and DNA barcoding
- **Aptamer-based assays**: SomaScan platform using modified aptamers (SOMAmer reagents)
- **Antibody arrays**: Various bead-based and planar array platforms
- **Immunoaffinity-MS**: Hybrid approaches combining affinity capture with MS detection

This template defines metadata requirements for annotating these diverse affinity-based proteomics experiments, enabling data integration across platforms and with mass spectrometry data.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation

Affinity proteomics experiments have characteristics that differ significantly from mass spectrometry proteomics:

1. **Pre-defined protein panels**: Target proteins are determined by the reagent panel, not by detection
2. **No mass spectrometry (typically)**: Detection is often via sequencing, fluorescence, or electrochemiluminescence
3. **High throughput**: Many samples can be processed in parallel
4. **Different quantification scales**: Relative units (NPX, RFU) rather than intensity or spectral counts
5. **Platform-specific considerations**: Each technology has unique metadata requirements

These aspects require specific metadata to enable proper data interpretation and cross-platform comparison.

[[scope]]
== Scope

This template covers:

- Proximity Extension Assays (Olink)
- Aptamer-based protein profiling (SomaScan)
- Antibody/bead arrays (Luminex, MSD)
- Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA)
- Immunoaffinity enrichment followed by MS detection

IMPORTANT: While affinity proteomics extends SDRF-Proteomics, many of these technologies do not use mass spectrometry. The `technology type` and `assay name` columns are adapted accordingly.

[[technology-type]]
== Technology Type Annotation

For affinity proteomics, the `technology type` column MUST reflect the actual detection technology:

|===
|Platform |Technology Type Value

|Olink PEA
|protein profiling by proximity extension assay

|SomaScan
|protein profiling by aptamer-based assay

|Luminex/MSD
|protein profiling by immunoassay

|RPPA
|protein profiling by reverse phase protein array

|Immunoaffinity-MS
|proteomic profiling by mass spectrometry

[[best-practices]]
== Best Practices for Affinity Proteomics Annotation

1. **Specify the platform clearly**: Always identify the specific technology platform used.

2. **Document panel information**: Include panel name, version, and composition for reproducibility.

3. **Report quantification units**: Different platforms use different scales (NPX, RFU, pg/mL) - always specify.

4. **Note sample requirements**: Document sample type, volume, and any dilutions applied.

5. **Include QC information**: When available, note quality control status or warnings.

6. **Use appropriate technology type**: Do not use MS-specific technology types for non-MS platforms.

7. **Link to panel documentation**: When possible, reference manufacturer documentation for panel contents.

8. **Consider cross-platform studies**: When combining affinity and MS data, clearly distinguish samples and methods.

[[cross-platform]]
== Cross-Platform Data Integration

When combining affinity proteomics with mass spectrometry data:

- Use consistent `source name` values for the same biological samples
- Clearly distinguish technology types in the SDRF
- Consider using `characteristics[biosample accession number]` to link related samples
- Document any batch effects or platform-specific normalizations

[[template-file]]
== Template File

The affinity proteomics SDRF template file is available in this directory:

- link:affinity-proteomics-template.sdrf.tsv[affinity-proteomics-template.sdrf.tsv]

[[validation]]
== Validation

Affinity proteomics SDRF files should be validated using the sdrf-pipelines tool:

[source,bash]
----
pip install sdrf-pipelines
parse_sdrf validate-sdrf --sdrf_file your_file.sdrf.tsv --template affinity-proteomics
----

NOTE: Some MS-specific validations may not apply to non-MS affinity platforms.
