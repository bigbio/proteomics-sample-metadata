== Status

**Status:** Construction Artifact

**Version:** 1.1.0

[WARNING]
====
**This template cannot be used directly.** It is a construction artifact that defines shared columns inherited by all other templates. Use `ms-base` or `affinity-base` instead.
====

[[abstract]]
== Abstract

The base template defines the universal columns shared by ALL proteomics experiments, regardless of technology (MS or affinity-based). It serves as the foundation upon which technology-specific templates are built.

This template exists to:

* Centralize shared column definitions
* Ensure consistency across technology templates
* Simplify maintenance of common metadata requirements

[[columns]]
== Columns Defined

The base template defines these shared columns:

|===
|Column Name |Requirement |Description

|source name
|Required
|Unique identifier for the biological sample

|characteristics[organism]
|Required
|Species of the sample (NCBI Taxonomy)

|characteristics[organism part]
|Required
|Anatomical part from which sample was derived

|characteristics[cell type]
|Recommended
|Cell type of the sample

|characteristics[biological replicate]
|Required
|Biological replicate identifier

|assay name
|Required
|Unique identifier for the data acquisition run

|technology type
|Required
|Type of technology used

|comment[instrument]
|Required
|Instrument used for data acquisition (MS or affinity platform)

|comment[technical replicate]
|Recommended
|Technical replicate identifier

|comment[data file]
|Required
|Name of the raw data file
|===

[[usage]]
== Usage

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Do not use this template directly.** Instead, use:

* `ms-base` - For mass spectrometry-based proteomics
* `affinity-base` - For affinity-based proteomics (Olink, SomaScan)
