[[status]]
== Status of this Template

This document provides guidelines for annotating crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) experiments in SDRF-Proteomics format. This template extends the core SDRF-Proteomics specification with crosslinking-specific metadata fields.

**Status:** Draft - This template is under active development and may change significantly.

**Version:** 1.0.0-dev - 2025-01

[[abstract]]
== Abstract

Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) is a powerful structural proteomics technique that uses chemical reagents to covalently link amino acid residues in close spatial proximity. This approach provides valuable information for:

- Protein structure determination and validation
- Protein-protein interaction mapping
- Characterization of protein complexes
- Integrative structural biology pipelines
- In vivo and in situ structural studies

This template defines the additional metadata requirements for properly annotating crosslinking mass spectrometry datasets in SDRF-Proteomics format, enabling proper interpretation of structural constraints and data reproducibility.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation

Crosslinking mass spectrometry experiments have unique characteristics that distinguish them from standard proteomics:

1. **Crosslinking chemistry**: Various reagents with different specificities and spacer arm lengths are used
2. **Distance constraints**: The crosslinker spacer arm defines the maximum distance between linked residues
3. **Reaction conditions**: Crosslinking efficiency depends on concentration, time, and temperature
4. **Specialized data analysis**: XL-MS requires dedicated search engines that identify crosslinked peptide pairs
5. **Enrichment strategies**: Crosslinked peptides are often enriched using specific strategies (SEC, SCX, affinity)

These aspects require additional metadata beyond standard SDRF-Proteomics fields.

[[connections]]
== Connections to Structural Biology

Crosslinking mass spectrometry data is typically integrated with:

- **Cryo-EM structures**: As distance restraints for modeling
- **X-ray crystallography**: For structure validation
- **AlphaFold predictions**: For model assessment
- **Integrative modeling platforms**: IMP, HADDOCK, Rosetta
- **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: For structure deposition

When structures are available, linking to PDB identifiers is RECOMMENDED.

[[additional-ontologies]]
== Additional Ontologies

In addition to the ontologies supported by the core SDRF-Proteomics specification, crosslinking templates utilize:

- **PSI-MS CV**: Contains crosslinker-specific terms (MS:1002494 - crosslink donor, etc.)
- **ChEBI**: For chemical compound identification
- **XLMOD**: Crosslinking modification database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/xlmod)

[[best-practices]]
== Best Practices for Crosslinking Annotation

1. **Always specify crosslinker**: Document the exact crosslinking reagent used, including manufacturer if relevant.

2. **Report distance constraints**: Include spacer arm length and maximum Ca-Ca distance for structural interpretation.

3. **Document reaction conditions**: Time, temperature, and concentration affect crosslinking efficiency and reproducibility.

4. **Specify enrichment method**: Crosslink enrichment is critical for data quality and should be documented.

5. **Note cleavability**: For MS-cleavable crosslinkers, indicate this property as it affects data analysis strategy.

6. **Use controlled vocabularies**: Prefer XLMOD or PSI-MS CV terms for crosslinker identification.

7. **Include quenching information**: Document how the reaction was stopped.

8. **Link to structures**: When available, reference related PDB entries for structural context.
