== What is SDRF-Proteomics?

SDRF-Proteomics is a simple tab-separated file that describes your proteomics samples and links them to your data files. Think of it as a spreadsheet where:

- Each **row** = one sample-to-file relationship
- Each **column** = one piece of information (organism, disease, instrument, etc.)

That's it. No programming required.

== Your First SDRF File in 5 Minutes

=== Step 1: Choose Your Template

Answer these questions to find your template:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Question |Template to Use

|Is your sample from humans?
|Use **human** template

|Is your sample from mouse, rat, zebrafish?
|Use **vertebrates** template

|Is your sample from insects, worms?
|Use **invertebrates** template

|Is your sample from plants?
|Use **plants** template

|Is your sample a cell line?
|Use **cell-lines** template

|None of the above?
|Use **default** template
|===

Download templates from: https://github.com/bigbio/proteomics-metadata-standard/tree/master/sdrf-proteomics/templates

=== Step 2: Fill in Your Sample Information

Open your template in Excel or any spreadsheet software. For each sample, fill in:

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Column |What to Write |Example

|source name
|A unique name for your sample
|patient_001

|characteristics[organism]
|Species name (lowercase)
|homo sapiens

|characteristics[organism part]
|Tissue or body part
|liver

|characteristics[disease]
|Disease name, or "normal" if healthy
|hepatocellular carcinoma
|===

=== Step 3: Fill in Your Data File Information

For each row, also fill in information about the raw file:

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Column |What to Write |Example

|assay name
|A name for this MS run
|run_001

|comment[label]
|Type of labeling
|label free sample

|comment[instrument]
|Mass spectrometer used
|Q Exactive HF

|comment[data file]
|Your raw file name
|sample_001.raw
|===

=== Step 4: Add Your Experimental Variables

If you're comparing groups (e.g., disease vs. healthy), add a `factor value` column:

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Column |What to Write |Example

|factor value[disease]
|The variable you're studying
|normal or hepatocellular carcinoma
|===

=== Step 5: Validate Your File

Save your file as `.sdrf.tsv` and validate it:

[source,bash]
----
pip install sdrf-pipelines
parse_sdrf validate-sdrf --sdrf_file your_file.sdrf.tsv
----

TIP: A web-based validator is also available for users who prefer not to use command line tools.

== Complete Example

Here's a complete SDRF file for a simple human liver cancer study:

|===
|source name |characteristics[organism] |characteristics[organism part] |characteristics[disease] |assay name |comment[label] |comment[instrument] |comment[data file] |factor value[disease]

|patient_001
|homo sapiens
|liver
|hepatocellular carcinoma
|run_001
|label free sample
|Q Exactive HF
|patient_001.raw
|hepatocellular carcinoma

|patient_002
|homo sapiens
|liver
|hepatocellular carcinoma
|run_002
|label free sample
|Q Exactive HF
|patient_002.raw
|hepatocellular carcinoma

|control_001
|homo sapiens
|liver
|normal
|run_003
|label free sample
|Q Exactive HF
|control_001.raw
|normal

|control_002
|homo sapiens
|liver
|normal
|run_004
|label free sample
|Q Exactive HF
|control_002.raw
|normal
|===

== Common Experiment Types

=== Label-Free DDA (Most Common)

Required columns:

- `source name`
- `characteristics[organism]`
- `characteristics[organism part]`
- `characteristics[disease]`
- `assay name`
- `comment[label]` = "label free sample"
- `comment[instrument]`
- `comment[data file]`

=== TMT/iTRAQ Labeling

Same as above, but:

- `comment[label]` = TMT126, TMT127N, TMT127C, etc.
- Multiple samples share the same `comment[data file]`

|===
|source name |... |comment[label] |comment[data file]

|sample_A |... |TMT126 |multiplex_1.raw
|sample_B |... |TMT127N |multiplex_1.raw
|sample_C |... |TMT127C |multiplex_1.raw
|===

=== Fractionated Samples

Add a `comment[fraction identifier]` column:

|===
|source name |... |comment[fraction identifier] |comment[data file]

|sample_001 |... |1 |sample_001_F1.raw
|sample_001 |... |2 |sample_001_F2.raw
|sample_001 |... |3 |sample_001_F3.raw
|===

=== Cell Line Experiments

Use the cell-lines template and include:

- `characteristics[cell line]` = HeLa, HEK293, etc.
- `characteristics[cellosaurus accession]` = CVCL_0030 (from https://www.cellosaurus.org/)

== Common Mistakes to Avoid

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Mistake |Correct

|`Source Name` (capitalized)
|`source name` (lowercase)

|`characteristics [organism]` (space before bracket)
|`characteristics[organism]` (no space)

|`control` for healthy samples
|`normal` for healthy samples

|Leaving cells empty
|Use `not available` or `not applicable`

|`sourcename` (no space)
|`source name` (with space)
|===

== Where to Find Correct Values

|Organism names

|Tissue/organ names

|===

TIP: Don't worry about finding the exact ontology term. Just write the common name (e.g., "liver", "breast cancer") and the validator will check it for you.
