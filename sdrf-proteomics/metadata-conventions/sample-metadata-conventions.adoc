[[status]]
== Status of this Convention

This document provides guidelines for annotating general sample metadata in SDRF-Proteomics format. These conventions apply to samples from any organism (human, animal, plant).

**Version 1.0.0** - 2025-01

[[abstract]]
== Abstract

Sample metadata conventions define standardized formats for common properties that apply across all organism types. This convention covers:

- Organism annotation
- Organism part / tissue annotation
- Age and temporal information
- Biological sex
- Disease and health status
- Developmental stage
- Cell type annotation

For human-specific metadata (disease staging, comorbidities, treatment history, demographics, lifestyle factors), see link:human-sample-metadata.adoc[Human Sample Metadata Convention].

[[derived-samples]]
== Derived Samples

=== Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX)

In cancer research, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are commonly used. In these experiments, the patient's tumor is transplanted into another organism, usually a mouse.

==== Column

`characteristics[xenograft]`

==== Metadata Rules

IMPORTANT: When annotating PDX samples, the metadata such as age and sex MUST refer to the original patient and not the host organism (mouse).

==== Format

The value should describe the growth condition:

|===
|Example Value |Description

|pancreatic cancer cells grown in nude mice
|PDX from pancreatic cancer patient

|breast tumor grown in NSG mice
|PDX from breast cancer patient

|not applicable
|Non-PDX samples
|===

==== Linking PDX to Original Tumor

For experiments where both the PDX and the original tumor are measured:

|===
|Column |PDX Sample |Original Tumor Sample

|characteristics[xenograft]
|Description of growth condition
|not applicable

|characteristics[source name]
|Reference to tumor sample's source name
|not applicable

|characteristics[individual]
|Patient identifier
|Patient identifier (same as PDX)
|===

==== Example

|===
|source name |characteristics[individual] |characteristics[xenograft] |characteristics[organism] |characteristics[age] |characteristics[sex]

|tumor_001
|patient_A
|not applicable
|homo sapiens
|65Y
|male

|pdx_001
|patient_A
|pancreatic adenocarcinoma grown in nude mice
|homo sapiens
|65Y
|male
|===

NOTE: Both tumor and PDX samples reference the same patient using `characteristics[individual]`. The age and sex refer to the original patient, not the host mouse.

[[synthetic-peptide]]
== Synthetic Peptide Libraries

Synthetic peptide libraries are commonly used in proteomics for:

- Benchmarking analytical and bioinformatics methods and algorithms
- Improving peptide identification/quantification using spectral libraries

=== Column

`characteristics[synthetic peptide]`

=== Standard Values

|===
|Value |Description

|synthetic
|Sample is a synthetic peptide library

|not synthetic
|Sample is not synthetic (biological sample)
|===

|===
|Column |Recommendation

|characteristics[organism]
|MAY be specified if the library was designed from specific species peptides

|characteristics[organism part]
|not applicable

|characteristics[disease]
|not applicable

|characteristics[cell type]
|not applicable

|characteristics[age]

[[enrichment-process]]
== PTM Enrichment Studies

For post-translational modification (PTM) enriched experiments such as phosphoproteomics or glycoproteomics, the enrichment process SHOULD be annotated.

=== Column

`characteristics[enrichment process]`

=== Ontology

- **Primary**: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo[EFO]

=== Standard Values

|===
|Value |Description

|enrichment of phosphorylated Protein
|Phosphoproteomics enrichment

|enrichment of glycosylated Protein
|Glycoproteomics enrichment

|not applicable
|No PTM enrichment performed
|===

=== Usage as Factor Value

This characteristic can be used as a _factor value[enrichment process]_ to differentiate the expression between proteins in the PTM-enriched sample compared with the control.

=== Example

|===
|source name |characteristics[enrichment process] |factor value[enrichment process]

|phospho_sample
|enrichment of phosphorylated Protein
|enrichment of phosphorylated Protein

|control_sample
|not applicable
|not applicable
|===

[[best-practices]]
== Best Practices

1. **Use lowercase**: All controlled vocabulary values should be lowercase (except proper nouns in disease names).

2. **Use standard age format**: Prefer `{Number}{Unit}` format (e.g., `45Y`, `10W`, `3D`).

3. **Use ontology terms**: Map values to MONDO (diseases), CL (cell types), UBERON (anatomy), PATO (phenotypes).

4. **Be consistent**: Use the same format for all samples in a dataset.

5. **Document unknowns**: Use `not available` (unknown) or `not applicable` (not relevant) - never leave cells empty.

6. **Use specific terms**: Prefer specific ontology terms over generic ones when the information is available.

7. **Validate before submission**: Use sdrf-pipelines to validate ontology mappings.
