[[introduction]]
== Introduction

This document provides an overview of tools that support the SDRF-Proteomics format. These tools are developed by the community to help researchers create, validate, and use SDRF files in their proteomics workflows.

The tools are organized into three categories:

* **Annotators**: Tools for creating and editing SDRF files
* **Validators**: Tools for validating SDRF files against the specification
* **Analysis Tools**: Proteomics analysis pipelines that accept SDRF as input

[[annotators]]
== Annotators

Annotator tools help researchers create SDRF files from scratch or from existing metadata. These tools typically provide user-friendly interfaces to guide users through the annotation process.
