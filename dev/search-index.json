Use lowercase for all controlled vocabulary values (except proper nouns in disease names).\n2. Use ontology terms mapped to MONDO (diseases), CL (cell types), UBERON (anatomy), PATO (phenotypes).\n3. Be consistent with format across all samples in a dataset.\n4. Document unknowns using not available (unknown) or not applicable (not relevant) - never leave cells empty.\n5. Validate before submission using sdrf-pipelines to check ontology mappings.\n\nGeneral Formatting Conventions\n\nCapitalization Rules\n\nMost controlled vocabulary values are recommended to be lowercase:\n\n- Organism names: homo sapiens, mus musculus\n- Organism parts: blood, liver, brain\n- Sex values: male, female\n\nExceptions (retain proper noun capitalization):\n\n- Ancestry categories (geographic populations): African, European, South Asian\n- Cell line names: HeLa, HEK293, K562\n\n Validators should normalize common capitalization variations (e.g., accept both Homo sapiens and homo sapiens), but submitters should use lowercase for consistency.\n\nOrganism\n\nColumn: characteristics[organism]\n\nOntology: NCBI Taxonomy (NCBITaxon)\n\nUse the scientific name in lowercase.
