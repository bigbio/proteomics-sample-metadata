Investigation Title	System-wide analysis of SUMOylation dynamics in response to replication stress reveals novel SUMO target proteins and acceptor lysines relevant for genome stability
Experiment Description	Genotoxic agents can cause replication fork stalling in dividing cells due to DNA lesions, eventually leading to replication fork collapse when the damage is not repaired. Small Ubiquitin-like Modifiers (SUMOs) are known to counteract replication stress, nevertheless, only a small number of relevant SUMO target proteins are known. To address this, we have purified and identified SUMO-2 target proteins regulated by replication stress in human cells. The developed methodology enabled single step purification of His10-SUMO-2 conjugates under denaturing conditions with high yield and high purity. The methodology is generic and is widely applicable in the ubiquitin field. Following statistical analysis on five biological replicates, a total of 566 SUMO-2 targets were identified. After 2 hours of Hydroxyurea treatment, 10 proteins were up-regulated for SUMOylation and 2 proteins were down-regulated for SUMOylation, whereas after 24 hours, 35 proteins were up-regulated for SUMOylation and 13 proteins were down-regulated for SUMOylation. A site-specific approach was used to map over 1,000 SUMO-2 acceptor lysines in target proteins. A large subset of these identified proteins function in one network that consists of interacting replication factors, transcriptional regulators, DNA damage response factors including MDC1, ATR-interacting protein ATRIP, the Bloom syndrome protein and the BLM-binding partner RMI1, the crossover junction endonuclease EME1, BRCA1 and CHAF1A. Furthermore, centromeric proteins and signal transducers were dynamically regulated by SUMOylation upon replication stress. Our results uncover a comprehensive network of SUMO target proteins dealing with replication damage and provide a framework for detailed understanding of the role of SUMOylation to counteract replication stress. Ultimately, our study reveals how a post-translational modification is able to orchestrate a large variety of different proteins to integrate different nuclear processes with the aim of dealing with the induced DNA damage

Protocol Description	All the experiments were performed on an EASY-nLC 1000 system (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) connected to a Q-Exactive orbitrap or a Q-Exactive Plus orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) through a nano-electrospray ion source. For the Q-Exactive, peptides were separated in a 13 cm analytical column with an inner-diameter of 75 μm, in-house packed with 1.8 μm C18 beads (Reprospher-DE, Pur, Dr. Manish, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). The Q-Exactive Plus was coupled to 15 cm analytical columns with an inner-diameter of 75 μm, in-house packed with 1.9 μm C18 beads (Reprospher-DE, Pur, Dr. Manish, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany), employing a column oven (PRSO-V1, Sonation, Biberach) to heat the column to 50 °C.  The gradient length was 120 minutes from 2% to 95% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 200 nL/minute. The mass spectrometers were operated in data-dependent acquisition mode with a top 10 method. Full-scan MS spectra were acquired at a target value of 3 x 106 and a resolution of 70,000, and the Higher-Collisional Dissociation (HCD) tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were recorded at a target value of 1 x 105 and with a resolution of 17,500 with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 25%. The maximum MS1 and MS2 injection times were 20 ms and 60 ms, respectively. The precursor ion masses of scanned ions were dynamically excluded (DE) from MS/MS analysis for 60 sec. Ions with charge 1, and greater than 6 were excluded from triggering MS2 events. For samples enriched for identification of SUMO-2 targets acceptor lysines, a 120 minute gradient was used for chromatography. Data dependent acquisition with a top 5 method was used. Maximum MS1 and MS2 injection times was 20 ms and 250 ms, respectively. Resolutions, normalized collision energy and automatic gain control target were set as mentioned previously. Dynamic exclusion were set to 20 sec.	Protein level Database searches were performed with Trypsin/P and Lys-C specificity, allowing two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was considered as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine, phosphorylation and acetylation of protein N-termini were considered as variable modifications. Match between runs was performed with 0.7 min match time window and 20 min alignment time window. The minimum peptide length was set to 6. Protein groups considered for quantification required at least 2 peptides, including unique and razor peptides. Peptides and proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of 1% according to Cox et al. Label-free quantification was carried out, as described in Figure 4, using MaxLFQ without fast LFQ. Proteins identified by the same set of peptides were combined to a single protein group by MaxQuant.  Site level Site-specific purifications were performed in biological quadruplicate, and all samples were measured in technical duplicate. All 24 RAW files were analyzed by MaxQuant (version 1.5.1.2). The first search was carried out with a mass accuracy of 20 ppm, while the main search used 6 ppm for precursor ions. Database searches were performed with Trypsin/P specificity, allowing two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was considered as a fixed modification. Mass tolerance of MS/MS spectra was set to 20 ppm to search against an in silico digested UniProt reference proteome for Homo sapiens (29 October 2014, 88812 proteins). Additionally, MS/MS data was searched against a list of 245 common mass spectrometry contaminants by Andromeda. Pyro-QQTGG (K), QQTGG (K), phosphorylation (STY) and were set as variable modifications. As a mean to increase identification certainty, diagnostic peaks were searched within MS/MS spectra corresponding to SUMOylated peptides. The default minimum Andromeda score for accepting MS/MS spectra corresponding to modified peptides was left at 40 and the minimum delta score was left at 6. Additionally identified Pyro-QQTGG and QQTGG sites without diagnostic peaks, matching reversed sequences, or having a localization probability of less than 0.9 were excluded. Match between run were used with 0.7 min match time window and 20 min alignment time window.   Sequence windows of  -15 to +15 with respect to the identified SUMO-2 targets acceptor lysines were used to generate a SUMOylation motif, employing iceLogo software.
