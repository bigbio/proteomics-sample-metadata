Investigation Title	Characterisation of the transcriptome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using direct RNA sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry.
Experiment Description	Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.

Protocol Description	Protein lysates were prepared from the Vero E6 cells used for viral stock production. The cells were harvested in 4X Laemmli buffer (BioRad) and heated to 95 °C for 15 min. A 25 μl aliquot of the sample was separated using SDS-PAGE and the gel lane cut into 20 slices. The slices were reduced (10 mM DTT, 56 °C, 30 min), alkylated (100 mM iodoacetamide, room temperature, 20 min) and digested with trypsin (0.5 μg trypsin per slice, 37 °C, overnight). This whole process was repeated with chymotryptic digestion (0.5 μg chymotrypsin per slice, 25 °C, overnight). The resulting is the tryptic and chymotryptic peptides were fractionated using an Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). In brief, the peptides from each gel slice in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column (Thermo Scientific). The MS2 precursors were isolated with a quadrupole isolation window of 0.7m/z. ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGC target of 2E4, max injection time of 35ms and HCD collision energy of 30 %. A targeted analysis was performed to confirm the identification of the del-spike peptide (QTQTIASQSIIA) identified by a single peptide spectral match (PSM) in the initial analysis of chymotryptic peptides. However, there were changes to the acquisition workflow. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to include charge state 2) and previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (2s +/-10ppm). A targeted mass was specified with m/z 712.3759 and z=2.	The raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer software v2.1 (Thermo Scientific) and searched against the UniProt Chlorocebus sabaeus database (downloaded March 2020; 19525 sequences), an in-house ‘common contaminants’ database and a custom SARS-CoV-2 protein database using the SEQUEST HT algorithm. Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. Search criteria included oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da), acetylation of the protein N-terminus (+42.011 Da) and methionine loss plus acetylation of the protein N-terminus (-89.03 Da) as variable modifications and carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.021Da) as a fixed modification. For the phospho-proteome analysis, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine (+79.966 Da) was also included as a variable modification. Searches were performed with full tryptic or chymotryptic digestion and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages were allowed. The reverse database search option was enabled and all data was filtered to satisfy a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%.
