Investigation Title	Proteomic analysis of meningioma of different grades identifies potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers
Experiment Description	Meningiomas are common brain tumours arising from meningeal tissue. Despite the majority of them displaying benign features, they can cause mild to severe morbidity. The current main therapeutic approach is complete tumour resection commonly with adjunct radiation therapy. However, tumour location can hamper complete resection and chemotherapies are ineffective. In this study we aim to elucidate dysregulated pathways in meningioma pathogenesis and identify novel molecular targets by deciphering the proteome and phosphoproteome of different grades of meningiomas. Tumour lysates were collected from grade I, II and III frozenmeningioma specimens and three normal healthy human meninges.

Protocol Description	Frozen tissue purification for proteomic analysis – Meningioma tissue and normal meninges tissue was enriched for phosphoproteins using the Qiagen® PhosphoProtein Purification Kit. Tissue was manually homogenised in lysis buffer provided by the kit and 2.5 mg of protein used for purification following the manufacturer’s protocol. Meningioma tissue was enriched for phosphopeptides using Titansphere 10 μm TiO2 beads (GL Sciences, Inc., Japan). Tissue was manually homogenised in 8 M urea, 100 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0 lysis buffer compatible with phosphopeptide enrichment and 2.5 mg of protein used for enrichment. Tissue sample preparation for LC-MS/MS experiments – Gel-based fractionation of proteins and phosphoproteins prior to tryptic digestion was conducted by gel electrophoresis using 4-15% Mini -PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-350 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), and divided into 6 slices per lane. Gel slices were treated with 10 mM DTT and 50 mM 2-iodoacetamide and digested by trypsin overnight at 37°C. Tryptic digests were acidified to a final concentration of 2% TFA and purified by STAGE tips. Proteins for phosphopeptide enrichment were subjected to in-solution digestion using 0.1 M DTT and 50 mM 2-iodoacetamide and digested by Lys-C protease overnight at 37°C, followed by trypsin overnight at 37°C. Tryptic digests were acidified to a final concentration of 0.1% TFA and desalted using HyperSep™ C18 Cartridges (Thermo Fisher Sceintific). Following phosphopeptide enrichment, peptides were acidified with 200 μl of 10% TFA and purified by STAGE tips.	Peptide identification and quantification by MaxQuant – Andromeda search engine integrated in the MaxQuant (Version 1.5.0.30) was used to identify proteins. Peptide mass spectra were searched against the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org/downloads, November 2015) and supplemented with sequences of frequently observed contaminants. Andromeda search parameters for protein identification specified a first search mass tolerance of 20 ppm and a main search tolerance of 4.5 ppm for the parental peptide and 0.5 Da mass tolerance for fragmentation spectra with a trypsin protease specificity allowing up to two mis-cleaved sites. Carboxyamidomethylation of cysteines was specified as a fixed modification, oxidation of methionine, deamidation of glutamine and asparagine, and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Minimal required peptide length was specified at 6 amino acids. MaxQuant performed an internal mass calibration of measured ions and peptide validation by the target decoy approach as described [37]. Proteins detected by at least two ‘razor and unique’ peptides in one of the samples with a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) for proteins and peptides were accepted. Excluded from validation were proteins identified by site only, external contaminants and reversed proteins. Proteins were label free quantified with label free quantification (LFQ) values representing normalised summed peptide intensities correlating with protein abundances, where the ‘match between run’ option was permitted between runs with a 0.7 min elution time interval.
