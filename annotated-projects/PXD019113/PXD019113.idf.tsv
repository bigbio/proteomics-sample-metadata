Investigation Title	The Global Phosphorylation Landscape of SARS-CoV-2 Infection
Experiment Description	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected over 3 million people worldwide and caused over 200,000 deaths since it emerged in late 2019. There is an urgent need to develop therapies that can limit SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and pathogenesis. Due to the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there currently exists a lack in the knowledge of the host cellular pathways that sustain infection and contribute to pathogenesis. Here, we present a quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells.

Protocol Description	Cell lysis and digestion. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in lysis buffer (8 M urea, 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), 150 mM NaCl, protease inhibitor (mini-cOmplete, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (phosSTOP, Roche). tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) was added to a final concentration of 4 mM. Lysis was performed via probe sonication, on ice, at 20% amplitude for 20 s., followed by 10 s. of rest. This process was performed a total of three times. Following lysis, protein concentration was determined using Bradford assay. Iodoacetamide (IAA) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 10 mM, and samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes. Excess IAA was quenched by the addition of dithiothreitol to 10 mM, followed by incubation in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes. Samples were then diluted with 0.1 M ABC (pH = 8.0) to a final urea concentration of 2 M. Trypsin (Promega) was added at a 1:100 (enzyme: protein) ratio and digested overnight at 37C with rotation. Following digestion, 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to each sample to a final pH ~2. Samples were desalted under vacuum using Sep Pak tC18 cartridges (Waters). Each cartridge was activated with 1 mL 80% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% TFA, then equilibrated with 3 x 1 mL of 0.1% TFA. Following sample loading, cartridges were washed with 4 x 1 mL of 0.1% TFA, and samples were eluted with 4 x 0.5 mL 50% ACN/0.25% formic acid (FA). 20 ug of each sample was kept for protein abundance measurements, and the remainder was used for phosphopeptide enrichment. Samples were dried by Speed-Vac. Phosphopeptide enrichment. For each sample, 400 µL of 50% Superflow bead slurry (Qiagen) were added to a 2 mL bio-spin column. Beads were incubated with 100 mM EDTA, washed with H2O, incubated with 100 mM FeCl3, and washed with H2O and 0.5% FA to remove residual Fe. 1 mg of digested peptides were resuspended in 75% ACN/0.15 % TFA and incubated with beads. Following incubation, non-enriched peptides were eluted with 80% ACN/0.1% TFA. Phosphopeptides were eluted by addition of 500 mM potassium phosphate. Mass spectrometry data acquisition and analysis. Digested samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometry system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an Easy nLC 1200 ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced via a Nanospray Flex nanoelectrospray source. For all analyses, samples were injected on a C18 reverse phase column (25 cm x 75 um packed with ReprosilPur 1.9 µm particles). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% FA, and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% FA/80% ACN. Peptides were separated by an organic gradient from 5% to 30% mobile phase B over 112 minutes, followed by an increase to 58% B over 12 minutes, then held at 90% B for 16 minutes at a flow rate of 350 nL/min. Analytical columns were equilibrated with 6 uL of mobile phase A. To build a spectral library, one sample from each set of biological replicates was acquired in a data dependent manner. Data dependent analysis (DDA) was performed by acquiring a full scan over a m/z range of 400-1000 in the Orbitrap at 60,000 resolving power (@200 m/z) with a normalized AGC target of 300%, an  RF lens setting of 40%, and a maximum ion injection time of 60 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 60 s, with a 10 ppm exclusion width setting. Peptides with charge states 2-6 were selected for MS/MS interrogation using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD), with 20 MS/MS scans per cycle. For phosphopeptide enriched samples, MS/MS scans were analyzed in the Orbitrap using isolation width of 1.3 m/z, normalized HCD collision energy of 30%, normalized AGC of 200% at a resolving power of 30,000 with a 54 ms maximum ion injection time. Similar settings were used for data dependent analysis of samples used to determine protein abundance, with an MS/MS resolving power of 15,000 and a 22 ms maximum ion injection time. Data-independent analysis (DIA) was performed on all samples. An MS scan at 60,000 resolving power over a scan range 0f 390-1010 m/z, a normalized AGC target of 300%, an RF lens setting of 40%, and a maximum injection time of 60 msec was acquired, followed by DIA scans using 8 m/z isolation windows over 400-1000 m/z at a normalized HCD collision energy of 27%. Loop control was set to All. For phosphopeptide enriched samples, data was collected using a resolving power of 30,000 and a maximum ion injection time of 54 ms. Protein abundance samples were collected using a resolving power of 15,000 and a maximum ion injection time of 22 ms.	Spectral library generation. Raw mass spectrometry data from each DDA dataset were used to build separate libraries for DIA searches using the Pulsar search engine integrated into Spectronaut version 13.12.200217.43655 (Bruderer et al., 2015) by searching against a database of Uniprot Chlorocebus sequences (19,136 proteins, downloaded April 3, 2020) and 29 Sars-CoV-2 protein sequences translated from genomic sequence downloaded from GISAID (accession EPI_ISL_406596, downloaded April 7, 2020) with two mutations (G22661T Spike V367F and G26144T orf3a G251V). For protein abundance samples, data was searched using the default BSG settings, variable modification of methionine oxidation, static modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine, and filtering to a final 1% false discovery rate (FDR) at the peptide, peptide spectrum match (PSM), and protein level (Elias and Gygi, 2007). For phosphopeptide enriched samples, BSG settings were modified to include phosphorylation of S, T, and Y as a variable modification. The generated search libraries were used to perform directDIA searches of the DIA data. For protein abundance samples, default BSG settings were used, with no data normalization performed. For phosphopeptide enriched samples, the Significant PTM default settings were used, with no data normalization performed.   Quantitative analysis was performed in the R statistical programming language (version 3.6.1, 2019-07-05). Initial quality control analyses, including inter-run clusterings, correlations, principal components analysis, peptide and protein counts and intensities were completed with the R package artMS (version 1.5.3). Based on obvious outliers in intensities, correlations and clusterings, two runs were discarded from the protein abundance data and two runs were discarded from the phosphopeptide data.
