Investigation Title	Quantitative middle-down MS analysis of histone H3 proteoforms throughout lifespan in mice
Experiment Description	Replication-independent deposition of histone variant H3.3 into chromatin is essential for many biological processes, including development, oogenesis and nuclear reprogramming. Unlike replication-dependent H3.1/2 isoforms, H3.3 is expressed throughout the cell cycle and becomes enriched in postmitotic cells with age. However, lifelong dynamics of H3 variant replacement and the impact of this process on chromatin organization remain largely undefined.  To address this, we investigated genome-wide changes in histone H3 variants composition and H3 modification abundances throughout the lifespan in mice using quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) – based middle-down proteomics strategy. Using middle-down MS we demonstrate that H3.3 accumulates in the chromatin of various somatic mouse tissues throughout life, resulting in near complete replacement of H3.1/2 isoforms by the late adulthood. Accumulation of H3.3 is associated with profound changes in the global level of H3 methylation. H3.3-containing chromatin exhibits distinct stable levels of H3R17me2 and H3K36me2, different from those on H3.1/H3.2-containing chromatin, indicating a direct link between H3 variant exchange and histone methylation dynamics with age. In summary, our study provides the first time comprehensive characterization of dynamic changes in the H3 modification landscape during mouse lifespan and links these changes to the age-dependent accumulation of histone variant H3.3.

Protocol Description	Tissue samples (~40 mg) were homogenized on ice in 0.4 µL of nuclei isolation buffer (NIB; 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mM KCl, 11 mM CaCl2, 5 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM sodium butyrate and 0.3% NP-40) supplemented with protease (Complete; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Roche) using a pestle tissue grinder (Wheaton Science Products). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (1200 × g) and washed twice with ice-cold NIB (without NP-40).  Histones were acid extracted from the resulting nuclei pellet as previously described (Molden and Garcia 2014). Acid-precipitated histones were resuspended in 100 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 4) to a final protein concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml and subjected to endoproteinase GluC digestion (Calbiochem, 1:10 enzyme to substrate ratio) performed for 6 h at room temperature.   The resulting peptide mixture was analyzed by the WCX/HILIC-MS/MS method adapted from our previous studies (34,35). About four micrograms of peptide mixture were separated using Dionex Ultimate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo scientific) equipped with a two-column setup, consisting of a reversed-phase trap column (3 cm, 100 μm i.d., 360 μm o.d., packed with ReproSil, Pur C18AQ 3 μm; Dr. Maisch) and a WCX/HILIC analytical column (15 cm, 75 μm i.d. 360 μm o.d., packed with PolycatA 1000 Å, 1.9 μm, PolyLC Inc). Loading buffer was 0.1% formic acid (Merck Millipore) in water. Buffer A and B were prepared according to Young et al. (36). Peptides were eluted directly into an ESI tandem mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion ETD, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 130-min linear gradient of 65–85% buffer B at flow rate of 230 nl/min. The MS instrument was controlled by Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used with a spray voltage of 2.2 kV. The ion transfer tube temperature was 275 °C. Data acquisition was performed in the Orbitrap for both precursor ions and product ions. MS survey scans were obtained for the m/z range of 400-750 in the orbitrap with maximum ion injection time of 50 ms, auto gain control target 5 × 105, mass resolution of 60,000 and 3 microscans per each full MS event. The four most-intense ions with MS signal higher than 20000 counts were selected for fragmentation using electron transfer dissociation (ETD). In order to fragment only histone H3 proteoforms the following criteria for the precursor ion selection were applied:  m/z range of 667-703 and charge +8; m/z range of 593-625 and charge +9; m/z range of 533-562 and charge +10; m/z range of 485-512 and charge +11. MS/MS spectra were measured in the orbitrap with maximum ion injection time 100 ms, auto gain control target 2 × 105, mass resolution of 30,000 and 3 microscans per MS/MS.	Raw MS files were processed and searched with Mascot (version 2.3.2, Matrix Science, London, UK) using the Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4, Thermo Fischer Scientific) data analysis package. Spectra were deconvoluted by using Xtract (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following parameters: S/N threshold was set to 1, resolution at 400 m/z was 30,000 and monoisotopic mass only was true. The following parameters were used in the Mascot search: MS mass tolerance: 1.05 Da, to include possible errors in isotopic recognition; MS/MS mass tolerance: 0.02 Da; enzyme = GluC with no missed cleavage allowed; mono- and dimethylation (KR), trimethylation (K), acetylation (K), and acetylation (N-term) were set as variable modifications. MS/MS spectra were searched against mouse histone database, consisted of histone H3.1/H3.2 and H3.3 N-terminal sequences, covering residues 1–50, downloaded from Uniprot. CSV result files from Mascot were exported by ticking all the query level information and the start and end from the peptide match information (plus all the default settings). CSV files were imported and processed using the isoScale slim software (http://middle-down.github.io/Software) (Sidoli et al. 2014). isoScale slim was used with a tolerance of 0.015 Da and only c/z fragment ions allowed. Only PTMs with at least one site determining ion before and after the assigned PTM site were accepted. The relative abundance of each individual modification was calculated as the sum of relative abundances of all PTM forms containing this modification.
