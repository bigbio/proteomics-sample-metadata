Investigation Title	Human melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles reprogram dendritic cells potentially enabling lymph node metastases
Experiment Description	Evolution of melanoma from a primary tumor to widespread metastasis is crucially dependent on lymphatic spread. The mechanisms regulating the initial step in metastatic dissemination via regional lymph nodes remain largely unknown. We have previously described a dysfunctional immune profile that precedes evidence of metastasis in the first node draining from the primary tumor, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Herein, we explore the role of melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as mediators of this pre-metastatic niche through cargo-specific polarization of dendritic cells (DCs). Utilizing mass cytometry, pre-metastatic SLNs demonstrate compromised co-stimulatory CD80 expression compared to healthy lymph nodes. Similarly, DCs matured in vitro in the presence of melanoma EVs showed impaired co-stimulation and polarization towards a chronic inflammatory cytokine milieu.  Profiling of melanoma EV cargo identified shared proteomic and RNA signatures including the signaling axis S100A8, S100A9 and cognate receptor TLR4. Mechanistically, S100A8 and S100A9 compromised DC maturation, a phenotype which was partially recovered following TLR4 blockade. Early evidence demonstrates similar EVs can be isolated from human afferent lymphatic fluid ex vivo.  Taken together, we propose synergistic interactions among melanoma EV cargo are responsible for suppressing DC maturation, potentially explaining the survival of malignant melanocytes metastasizing into seemingly “normal” regional lymph nodes.

Protocol Description	The SDS-PAGE gel bands are prepared for mass spectrometry analysis using the following procedures.  Silver stained gel bands are destained with 15mM potassium ferricyanide/50mM sodium thioisulfate and the proteins reduced and alkylated with 50mM TCEP/50mM Tris pH8.1 and 20mM iodoacetamide/50mM Tris pH 8.1  at room temperature for 120 minutes in the dark. Proteins are digested in-situ  with 30ul (0.005ug/ul) trypsin (Promega Corporation, Madison WI) in 25 mM Tris pH 8.1 / 0.0002% Zwittergent 3-16, at 37C overnight, followed by peptide extraction with 25ul of 2% trifluoroacetic acid and 100ul acetonitrile. The pooled extracts are concentrated to less than 5ul on a spinning vacuum concentrator and brought up in 0.15% formic acid/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid for protein identification by nano-flow liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS) using either a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Elite Hybrid Mass Spectrometer or QExactivePlus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) each coupled to a Thermo Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system. The digest peptide mixture is loaded onto a 250nl OPTI-PAK trap (Optimize Technologies, Oregon City, OR) custom packed with Michrom Magic C18 solid phase (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA).  Chromatography is performed using 0.2 % formic acid in both the A solvent (98%water/2%acetonitrile) and B solvent (80% acetonitrile/10% isopropanol/10% water), and a 2%B to 40%B gradient at 325 nl/min through a hand packed PicoFrit (New Objective, Woburn, MA) 75m x 250mm column (Magic C18). The Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer experiment is set to perform a FT full scan from 340-1500 m/z with resolution set at 120,000 (at 400m/z), followed by linear ion trap rapid CID MS/MS scans on the top 25 ions. The FTMS AGC target is set to 1e6 and the ion tap MSn target is set to 1e4 with a max ion inject time of 250ms and 100ms respectively. The QExactive performed a full scan from 340-1500 m/z with resolution set at 70,000 (at 200 m/z) followed by HCD MS/MS scans on the top 20 ions at 17,500 resolution. The ACG targets are 1e6 and 1e5 for the full scans and MSMS scans respectively and 50ms is used for both maxIT.  Dynamic exclusion is used  and ions selected once are placed on an exclusion list for 30 or 45 seconds.	Tandem mass spectra were extracted by msconvert  and all MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.4.0) and X! Tandem (The GPM, thegpm.org; version X! Tandem Sledgehammer (2013.09.01.1)) set up to search the Swissprot all species database (Nov2014, 1093672 entries) with reverse decoy sequences. Both searches assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin and a parent ion tolerance of 10.0 PPM with fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.60 Da for the Elite or 0.02 Da for the QXactive Plus raw files Oxidation of methionine and the iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine were specified as variable modifications.   Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.6.2, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides.  Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii, Al et al Anal. Chem. (2003;75(17):4646-58).  Protein identifications matched across all 3 melanoma cell line EV preparations (SK-MEL-28, C32TG, A375) were reported.
