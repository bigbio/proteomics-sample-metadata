Investigation Title	Characterization of proteomic changes in human heart failure
Experiment Description	The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton can provide a mechanical resistance that can impede the motion of contracting cardiomyocytes.  Yet a role of the MT network in human heart failure is unexplored.  Here we utilize mass spectrometry to characterize changes to the cytoskeleton in human heart failure. Proteomic analysis of left ventricle tissue reveals a consistent upregulation and stabilization of intermediate filaments and MTs in human heart failure. This dataset includes left ventricular (LV) myocardium from 34 human hearts – either non-failing (NF) or failing hearts.  NF hearts are subdivided into normal or compensated hypertrophy (cHyp), while failing hearts are subdivided into ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with preserved or reduced ejection fraction (HCMpEF and HCMrEF, respectively). Further details on patient classification and in vivo parameters on each heart are listed in sample details.txt.

Protocol Description	Sample preparation. Human left ventricular tissue collected from a relatively healthy (myocardial rich, minimally fibrotic) region of the mid LV wall was used for mass spectrometry. Tissue was homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS (Cayman 10010263) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma).  Protein concentration was determined by protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad 5000205). 100 μg protein from each sample was precipitated as previously described (1).  The pellet was resuspended with 8 M urea, 100 mM NH4HCO3, and pH 8.0. Denaturation/reduction was performed in 8 M urea/5 mM dithiothreitol/25 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) for over 60 min in 52°C. The solution was stored at room temperature in 25 mM iodoacetamide at the dark for 60 min.  The urea was diluted to a concentration of 1 M with 25 mM NH4HCO3 and then digested with trypsin (1:50 ratio) at 37°C with shaking for 16 hrs. After tryptic digestion, peptide mixture was desalted with C18 micro spin column (C18, Harvard Apparatus, and Holliston, MA). The column was washed with 200 μL of 100 % acetonitrile and equilibrated with 200 μL of loading buffer (0.1 % formic acid). Peptides were loaded onto the column, washed with a loading buffer and eluted with 200 μL of 70 % acetonitrile/ 0.1 % formic acid. All steps for loading, washing, and elution were carried out with benchtop centrifugation (300 x g for 2 min).  The eluted samples were dried in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator, reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid.  Nano liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.  Desalted peptides were analyzed on a Q-Exactive (Thermo Scientific) attached to an EasyLC system run at 300 nL/min.  Peptides were eluted with a 170 min gradient from 2% to 32% ACN and to 98% ACN over 10 min in 0.1% formic acid.  Data dependent acquisition mode with a dynamic exclusion of 45 s was enabled.  One full MS scan was collected with scan range of 350 to 1600 m/z, resolution of 70 K, maximum injection time of 50 ms and automatic gain control (AGC) of 1E6.  Then, a series of MS2 scans were acquired for the most abundant ions from the MS1 scan (top 12).  Ions were filtered with charge 2-4.  An isolation window of 2.0 m/z was used with quadruple isolation mode.  Ions were fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with collision energy of 27%.  Orbitrap detection was used with scan range of 200 to 2000 m/z, resolution of 17.5 K, maximum injection time of 150 ms and automatic gain control of 5E6.	Proteomics MS data analysis including peptide identification and quantification.  MaxQuant version 1.5.3.30 was used to process the raw spectra35.  The uniprot human database was used for database searching.  Default sSearch parameters were used with default setting, including precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment mass tolerance of 20 ppm, trypsin cleavage and up to 2 mis-cleavage.  Carbamidomethyl [C] was set as fixed modification, while Oxidation [M] was set as variable modifications.  The target-decoy approach was used to filter the search results36, in which the false discovery rate was less than 1% at the peptide and protein level.  LFQ (Label-free quantification) and iBAQ (intensity-based absolute-protein-quantification) were enabled.
