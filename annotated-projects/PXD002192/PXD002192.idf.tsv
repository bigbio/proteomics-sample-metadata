Investigation Title	Proteomic identification of cysteine cathepsin substrates shed from the surface of cancer cells
Experiment Description	Extracellular cysteine cathepsins are known to drive cancer progression, but besides degradation of extracellular matrix proteins little is known about their physiological substrates and thus the molecular mechanisms they deploy. One of the major mechanisms used by other extracellular proteases to facilitate cancer progression is proteolytic release of the extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins or ectodomain shedding. Here we show using a mass spectrometry-based approach that cathepsins L and S act as sheddases and cleave extracellular domains of CAM adhesion proteins and transmembrane receptors from the surface of cancer cells.

Protocol Description	Cell treatment with recombinant cathepsins Cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, PANC-1, HT-144 and T98-G were grown to confluence in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza). Cells were detached using an enzyme-free cell dissociation solution (Millipore). Per condition, thirty million cells were incubated in parallel in 500 µl of PBS (Lonza) (pH 6.0, containing 0.5 mM DTT (Fluka Biochemica)), with human recombinant cathepsin L, S or B (1 µM and 0.2 µM) or with E-64-inhibited cathepsin (1 µM cathepsin L, S, or B incubated in PBS containing 20 µM broad spectrum cysteine cathepsin inhibitor E-64 (Peptide Institute) for 1 hour at 37°C) serving as a negative control for 1 hour at 37 °C, followed by collection of the supernatant (sample was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500 g, supernatant was removed and centrifuged again for 5 minutes at full speed). Residual cathepsin activity was blocked by the addition of E-64 to each sample (20 µM final concentration).  Mass spectrometry sample preparation  The obtained protein supernatants were separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel (Lonza). The gel was stained with Comassie Brilliant Blue and each protein lane was cut into 6 bands (6 samples), which were destained using destaining solution (25 mM NH4HCO3 (Fluka Biochemica), 50% acetonitrile (JT Baker)). The gel pieces were washed with acetonitrile and vacuum dried before rehydrating the gel pieces in reducing solution (10 mM DTT (Fluka Biochemica), 25 mM NH4HCO3) followed by an incubation at 56 °C for 45 minutes before exchanging to an alkylating solution (55 mM iodoacetamide (Amersham Biosciences), 25 mM NH4HCO3). The reaction was allowed to proceed in the dark for 30 minutes before washing the gel pieces with 25 mM NH4HCO3 using intense vortexing. Afterwards, the gel pieces were washed with acetonitrile and vacuum dried before rehydrating in 80 µl of trypsinization buffer (25 mM NH4HCO3) containing 1 µg of sequencing-grade modified porcine trypsine (Promega) per sample. The gel pieces were allowed to rehydrate on ice for 15 minutes before adding more trypsinization buffer to cover the gel pieces completely. Trypsin was then left to digest overnight at 37 °C. Next day, the trypsin solution was collected and remaining peptides were extracted from the gel pieces using extraction solution (50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid (JT Baker)). Trypsin solution was added to extraction solution and concentrated by vacuum drying to a final volume of about 20 µl.  Analysis by nano LC-MS/MS LC-MS/MS analyses were performed with an EASY-nanoLC II HPLC unit (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap LTQ Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The peptide sample was first loaded on a C18 trapping column (Proxeon EASY-ColumnTM, 2 cm length), 100 μm internal diameter, 5 μm 120Å, C18-A1 beads) and then separated on a 10 cm long C18 PicoFritTM AQUASIL analytical column, (75 µm internal diameter, 5 μm 100 Å, C18 beads) (New Objective) using forward flushing. Peptides were eluted with a 90 minute linear gradient of 5-50% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer with a mass range of 300-2000 m/z and 30000 resolution. MS/MS spectra were obtained by HCD fragmentation (normalized collision energy at 35) of the nine most intense precursor ions from the full MS scan. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with repeat count of 2 and 120 seconds exclusion time.	The database search and quantification by spectral counting were performed using the MaxQuant proteomics software (version 2.0.18), with imbedded Andromeda search engine. Search was performed against the human IPI protein database v.385 (89,952 sequences, 36,291,020 residues), using the trypsin cleavage specificity with maximum 2 missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as static, while methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were set as dynamic modifications. In the samples where deuteroacetylation was performed, deuteroacetylation of lysines and N-termini were set as dynamic modifications. Precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set at 6 and 20 ppm. Reversed database search was performed and false discovery rate (FDR), was set at 1% for peptide and protein identifications. In MaxQuant, identified peptides are assigned to protein groups rather than proteins and groups with at least 2 identified peptides were considered as positive identifications. Relative quantification of identified proteins was performed by spectral counting of their razor and unique peptides. This approach is known to reliably detect differences in protein abundance if at least 2-fold difference in spectral counts is observed. To minimize the number of false positives especially in the case of proteins with lower spectral counts (5-10 counts per protein), only proteins with at least 3-fold spectral count change were considered to have significantly altered abundance.
