MAGE-TAB Version	1.1
Investigation Title	Simplified Human Intestinal Microbiota (SIHUMIx) LC-MS/MS dataset
Experiment Description	Many functions in host���microbiota interactions are potentially influenced by intestinal transit times, but little is known about the effects of altered transition times on the composition and functionality of gut microbiota. To analyze these effects, we cultivated the model community SIHUMIx in bioreactors in order to determine the effects of varying transit times (TT) on the community structure and function. After five days of continuous cultivation, we investigated the influence of different medium TT of 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. For profiling the microbial community, we applied flow cytometric fingerprinting and revealed changes in the community structure of SIHUMIx during the change of TT, which were not associated with changes in species abundances. For pinpointing metabolic alterations, we applied metaproteomics and metabolomics and found, along with shortening the TT, a slight decrease in glycan biosynthesis, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism and, furthermore, a reduction in butyrate, methyl butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, and isovalerate concentrations. Specifically, B. thetaiotaomicron was identified to be affected in terms of butyrate metabolism. However, communities could recover to the original state afterward. This study shows that SIHUMIx showed high structural stability when TT changed���even four-fold. Resistance values remained high, which suggests that TTs did not interfere with the structure of the community to a certain degree.

Protocol Description	An amount of 2 mL bioreactor liquid was taken, centrifuged (3,200 x g, 10 min, 4 ��C), and the pellet was dissolved in 1 mL lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, NaCl 2 mg/mL, 1 mM PMSF, 4 mg/mL SDS). Bacteria were disrupted by bead beating (FastPrep-24, MP Biomedicals, Sanra Ana, CA, USA, 5.5 ms, 1 min, 3 cycles) followed by 15 min at 60 ��C (Thermomixer comfort 5355, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and ultra-sonication (UP50H, Hielscher, Teltow, Germany, cycle 0.5, amplitude 60%). Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay, according to the user manual (Pierce��� BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Furthermore, 100 ��g of protein was precipitated overnight at ���20 ��C with ice-cold acetone 1:5 (v/v) and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000x g. The pellet was used for sodium dodecyl sulfate poly acryl amid one-dimensional gel electrophorese (SDS���PAGE). SDS-PAGE analysis, in-gel digestion, and protein purification with ZipTip�� treatment were performed as described in Sch��pe SS et al., Microorganisms. 2019 Dec 3;7(12). An amount of 5 ��g peptide lysate was injected into nanoHPLC (UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano, Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Peptide separation was performed on a C18-reverse-phase trapping column (C18 PepMap100, 300 ��m x 5 mm, particle size 5 ��m, nano viper, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was followed by a C18-reverse-phase analytical column (Acclaim PepMap�� 100, 75 ��m x 25 cm, particle size 3 ��m, nanoViper, Thermo Fischer Scientific). Mass spectrometric analysis of peptides was performed on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled with a TriVersa NanoMate (Advion, Ltd., Harlow, UK) source in the liquid chromatography (LC) chip coupling mode. LC gradient,ionization mode, and the mass spectrometry mode were described in Sch��pe SS et al., Microorganisms. 2019 Dec 3;7(12).	Raw data were processed with Proteome Discoverer (v 2.2, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The search settings for the Sequest HT search engine were set to Trypsin (Full), Max. Missed Cleavage: 2, precursor mass tolerance: 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance: 0.02 Da. The protein-coding sequences of the eight SIHUMIx strains were downloaded from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/), combined, and used as database resulting in 29,558 protein sequences. The false discovery rates (FDR) were determined with the node Percolator [38] embedded in Proteome Discoverer (v 2.2) and we set the FDR threshold at a peptide level of 5%. The same threshold was set for the protein FDR (5%). Redundant proteins from the protein-coding database were automatically grouped in protein groups by applying the strict parsimony principle. Only the protein groups that explain at least one unique identified peptide were reported. Only the peptides that were not shared between different proteins or protein groups were used for the protein quantification through the Top3 approach implemented in the Proteome Discoverer (v 2.2). Further information are provided in Sch��pe SS et al., Microorganisms. 2019 Dec 3;7(12).
