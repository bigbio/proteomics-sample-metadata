Investigation Title	Cell-specific analysis of tumour-endothelial contact-intiated signalling
Experiment Description	Tumour cell extravasation is a key event for metastatic colonisation1. However, little is known about the signalling pathways that govern tumour cell adhesion to the endothelium and subsequent transmigration through the blood vessel wall. Here, we combine Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) and global phosphoproteomic analysis to identify cell-specific signalling pathways regulated between interacting tumour and endothelial cells. We identified over 2,000 unique phosphorylation sites, where 77 were specifically regulated in the tumour cells and 43 in the endothelial cells.

Protocol Description	An in vivo-selected lung metastatic derivative of MDA-MB-231 (subpopulation LM2-4175, hereafter referred to as LM2) was utilised to provide a cancer cell model system in which pathways driving extravasation processes are presumably enriched. Individual cell populations were differentially labelled with SILAC. Co-culture to study the LM2: HUVECs were grown to confluent monolayers in 15 cm dishes. Prior to co-culture, confluent monolayers of HUVECs were serum-starved for 1.5 hours and a reserved dish of HUVECs was used for counting. Fully labelled LM2 (~70% confluency) were serum-starved for 16 hours, harvested with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer and washed twice in serum-free, basal SILAC DMEM before counting. Heavy-labelled LM2 (Arg+10/Lys+8) were plated onto light-labelled HUVECs in a 2:1 LM2:HUVECs cell ratio in a volume of 3 mL per dish. Medium-labelled LM2 (Arg+6/Lys+4) were collected and kept in suspension in parallel to the co-culture. Cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 37˚C, 5% CO2. After incubation, unattached cells were removed from the dishes and counted to estimate the number of LM2 remaining attached to HUVEC monolayers. Heavy-labelled LM2 and HUVECs were lysed with medium-labelled LM2 in a 1:1 heavy:medium LM2 ratio with ice-cold 0.1 M Na2CO3 pH 11, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails.  Co-culture to study the HUVECs: the same protocol was followed using heavy- (in co-culture) and medium-labelled (in mono-culture) HUVECs with light-labelled LM2 in a 2:1 LM2:HUVECs cell ratio. Sample preparation: Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. MgCl2 was added to 1 mM final concentration for DNA digestion with Benzonase  for 15 minutes on ice. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 minutes at 4˚C to separate soluble proteins from membrane-associated proteins (pellet). Pellets were washed twice by two rounds of resuspension in lysis buffer followed by centrifugation (100,000 g for 30 minutes) and then resuspended in 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC). Protein concentrations of both cytoplasmic and membrane-enriched fractions were assessed by Bradford protein assay. Reduction, alkylation and digestion were performed by Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP; Vivacon 10 K) with 1 mg total proteins per unit. After buffer exchange to 40 mM ABC, proteins were reduced in 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 40 mM ABC for 45 minutes at room temperature and subsequently alkylated in 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 50 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Following, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and samples were incubated with sialidase A / NANase III  and PNGase F overnight at 37˚C to remove sialylations and N-glycosylations. Digestion was performed with Lys-C (1% w:w enzyme:substrate) for 3 hours at 37˚C, followed by addition of trypsin (1% w:w enzyme:substrate) for overnight digestion. Digested peptides were recovered by collecting the flow-through and subsequent washes of the FASP column membrane in ABC, and then 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 50% acetonitrile (MeCN). Recovered peptides were dried under. Dried peptide pellets were resuspended in TiO2 loading buffer (80% MeCN, 5% TFA, 1 M glycolic acid) and 3 mg Titansphere TiO2 beads (10 µm) were added per 500 µg peptides for 15 minutes shaking incubation at room temperature. The beads were then sequentially washed with i) loading buffer; ii) 80% MeCN, 1% TFA; and iii) 10% MeCN, 0.2% TFA. Phospho-peptides were eluted with 1% ammonium hydroxide, pH 11.3 (2 incubations for 10 minutes at room temperature). The flow through was then subjected to two more TiO2 enrichment steps and the three elutions were pooled. Samples were acidified with a mix of TFA / Formic acid (FA), desalted with OLIGO R3 micro-columns packed in-house and dried under vacuum. Discovery LC-MS/MS: Samples were resuspended in 0.1% FA and run on a LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a cHiPLC-Nanoflex chromatography system (Eksigent). Reversed-phase chromatographic separation was carried out on a 200 μm inner diameter (i.d.) x 0.5 mm trap column packed with C18 (3 μm bead size, 120 Å, Eksigent), a 75 μm i.d. x 15 cm column packed with C18 (3 μm bead size, 120 Å, Eksigent) with a linear gradient of 5-50% solvent B (100% MeCN + 0.1% FA) against solvent A (100% H2O + 0.1% FA) with a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode. Survey scans were performed in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400 and a Fourier Transform target value of 106 ions. The 10 most abundant ions were selected for fragmentation by higher-energy collisional dissociation and scanned in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 7,500 at m/z 400. Selected ions were dynamically excluded for 8 seconds. For accurate mass measurement, the lock mass option was enabled using the polydimethylcyclosiloxane ion (m/z 455.120025) as an internal calibrant.	For peptide identification, raw data files produced in Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific) were processed in Proteome Discoverer V1.3 (Thermo Scientific) and searched using Mascot (v2.2). Searches were performed with a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, a fragment mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Static modifications were limited to carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and variable modifications used were SILAC labels (Lys + 4.025 Da; Lys + 8.050 Da; Arg + 6.020 Da; Arg + 10.008 Da); oxidation of methionine; deamidation of asparagine and glutamine; and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The database used for searching was SwissProt (04/2013, number of entries 89601). Peptides were further filtered using a Mascot significance threshold < 0.05 and a False Discovery Rate < 0.01 (PEP value from Percolator 1). For relative phospho-peptide quantification, heavy/medium ratios were determined by Proteome Discoverer. All further data analysis was performed using the statistical package R (R Development Core Team, 2012; http://www.R-project.org/). Related R scripts and Markdown documents can be found online (https://github.com/mlocardpaulet/Tumour-endothelial_Contact-initiated_Phospho-signalling). Log2(heavy/medium) ratios (log2(H/M)) were compiled for each quantified phospho-peptide and normalised to the median of the log2(H/M) value of the same samples not subjected to phospho-enrichment. Peptide phospho-positions were first filtered based on a phosphoRS site probability > 60%, where only the best scoring peptide was kept before mapping the position on the protein sequence. One of the identified regulated phospho-peptides could not be uniquely attributed to either CLIP1 or CLIP2 due to sequence similarity and has thus been referred to as “CLIP1/2-S348” in the results (with Ser348 in CLIP1 corresponding to Ser352 in CLIP2). Phosphopeptides containing multiply phosphorylated residues have been referenced with all sites featuring phosphorylation (i.e. “AHNK-S210-S212-S216” which is phosphorylated on Ser210, Ser212 and Ser216). Manual assessment was performed on spectra in order to remove mixed spectra and erroneous quantification before further analysis. Phosphorylation sites were then considered regulated if their average log2(H/M) fold change was above 0.5 or under -0.5 (Supplementary Fig. 1). For each regulated phosphorylation site quantified in a minimum of two independent experiments, an unpaired two-sided t-test was performed (α = 0.05). Significant results based on these criteria are referred to in the paper as the “core” list of regulated phosphorylation sites.
