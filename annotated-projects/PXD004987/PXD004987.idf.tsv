Investigation Title	Proteomic characterization of neuromelanin granules isolated from human substantia nigra by laser-microdissection
Experiment Description	Neuromelanin is a complex polymer pigment found primarily in the dopaminergic neurons of human substantia nigra. Neuromelanin pigment is stored in granules including a protein matrix and lipid droplets. Neuromelanin granules are yet only partially characterised regarding their structure and function. To clarify the exact function of neuromelanin granules in humans, their enrichment and in-depth characterization from human substantia nigra is necessary. Previously published global proteome studies of neuromelanin granules in human substantia nigra required high tissue amounts. Due to the limited availability of human brain tissue we established a new method based on laser microdissection combined with mass spectrometry for the isolation and analysis of neuromelanin granules. With this method it is possible for the first time to isolate a sufficient amount of neuromelanin granules for global proteomics analysis from ten 10 µm tissue sections. In total 1,000 proteins were identified associated with neuromelanin granules. More than 68% of those proteins were also identified in previously performed studies. Our results confirm and further extend previously described findings, supporting the connection of neuromelanin granules to iron homeostasis and lysosomes, respectively endosomes. Hence, this method is suitable for the donor specific enrichment and proteomic analysis of neuromelanin granules.

Protocol Description	Neuromelanin granules and substantia nigra depleted of neuromelanin granules were enriched from cryopreserved human midbrain sections by laser micro dissection. Sample preparation for LC-MS/MS tryptic digest was performed as previously described by Molina et al. 2015 (doi: 10.1007/s00702-015-1414-4). After peptideconcentration estimation by amino acid analysis (see Plum et al. 2013 doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2013.07.015) 200 ng peptides were loaded on a capillary pre-column (Dionex, 100 µm × 2 cm, particle size 5 µm, pore size 100 Å) and washed for 7 min with 0.1% TFA. The pre-column was subsequently connected with an analytical C18 column (Dionex, 75 µm × 50 cm, particle size 2 µm, pore size 100 Å). Peptide separation was performed with 400 nL/min flow rate with a gradient that was initiated with 95% A (0.1% formic acid) and 5% B (84% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with increasing amounts of B (up to 40% within 95 min). The concentration of B was then increased to 95% within 2 min and maintained for 3 min. Afterwards, the column was again adjusted to 5% B. The LC system was directly coupled with a nano electrospray ionization source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to the Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. The system operated with a scan range from 300 to 2,000 m/z with a resolution of 30,000 and 500 ms maximum acquisition time. From each full scan, the 20 most intensive ions were selected for low-energy collision induced dissociation (CID) with 35% collision energy and 50 ms maximal acquisition time. After fragment ion (MS/MS) scans, the mass to charge (m/z) values of the precursor masses were maintained for 35 s on a dynamic exclusion list.	Raw files derived from the measurements were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). For these analyses, a workflow template was designed using the Mascot search algorithm (Matrix Science, London, UK, version 2.2.0) for protein identification. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance was 0.4 Da. The enzyme settings were set to “trypsin” and one possible missed cleavage site. Methionine oxidation was set as a variable modification and carbamidomethylation at cysteine was set as fixed modification. All data were searched against the UniProt/SwissProt decoy database (release 2015_05 of 29.04.2015; 548,454 entries without decoys) with a restriction to “Homo sapiens”.
