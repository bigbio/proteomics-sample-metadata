Investigation Title	AUTOMATED PHOSPHOPEPTIDE ENRICHMENT FROM MINUTE QUANTITIES OF FROZEN MALIGNANT MELANOMA TISSUE
Experiment Description	To acquire a deeper understanding of malignant melanoma (MM), it is essential to study the proteome of patient tissues. In particular, phosphoproteomics of MM has become of significant importance because of the central role that phosphorylation plays in the development of MM. Investigating clinical samples, however, is an extremely challenging task as there is usually only very limited quantities of material available to perform targeted enrichment approaches. Here, an automated phosphopeptide enrichment protocol using the AssayMap Bravo platform was applied to MM tissues and assessed for performance. The strategy proved to be highly-sensitive, less prone to variability, less laborious than existing techniques and adequate for starting quantities at the microgram level. An Fe(III)-NTA-IMAC-based enrichment workflow was applied to a dilution series of MM tissue lysates. The workflow was efficient in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility and phosphosite localization; and from only 12.5 µg of sample, more than 1,000 phosphopeptides were identified. In addition, from 60 µg of protein material the number of identified phosphoproteins from individual MM samples was comparable to previous reports that used extensive fractionation methods. Our data set included key pathways that are involved in MM progression; such as MAPK, melanocyte development and integrin signaling. Moreover, tissue-specific immunological proteins were identified, that have not been previously observed in the proteome of MM-derived cell lines. In conclusion, this workflow is suitable to study large cohorts of clinical samples that demand automatic and careful handling.

Protocol Description	Protein extraction was performed on sectioned, fresh-frozen tissues from human MM lymph node metastases tissues (10 µm) using the Bioruptor plus, model UCD-300 (Dieagenode). A total of 20 tissue sections were lysed in 100 µL lysis buffer containing 4 M urea and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. After briefly vortexing, samples were sonicated in the Bioruptor for 40 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 15 s at high power and 15 s without sonication at 4°C. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C. According to the instructions provided by the manufacturer, the protein content in the supernatant was determined using the colorimetric micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL).  Proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and sequentially alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at RT. To decrease the urea concentration, the samples were then diluted approximately seven times with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Digestion was performed in two steps. Proteins were firstly incubated with Lys-C at a 1:50 (w/w) ratio (enzyme:protein) for 5 h and then trypsin was then added at a 1:50 (w/w) ratio and the mixture incubated overnight at RT. The reaction was quenched by adding 20% TFA to a final concentration of ~1%. Peptides were desalted on the AssayMAP Bravo (Agilent Technologies) platform using the peptide cleanup v2.0 protocol. Briefly, C18 cartridges (Agilent, 5 µL bed volume) were primed with 100 µL 90% acetonitrile (ACN) and equilibrated with 70 µL 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 10 µL/min. The samples were loaded at 5 µL/min, followed by an internal cartridge wash with 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 10 µL/min. Peptides were eluted with 30 µL 80% ACN, 0.1% TFA and diluted to 200 µL with the same buffer for subsequent phosphopeptide enrichment.  Following the Phospho Enrichment v2.0 protocol, phosphorylated peptides were enriched using 5 µL Fe(III)-NTA cartridges on the AssayMAP Bravo platform. The cartridges were primed with 100 µL 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 300 µL/min and equilibrated with 50 µL loading buffer (80% ACN, 0.1% TFA) at 10 µL/min. Samples eluted from the C18 material were loaded onto the cartridge at 3.5 µL/min. The columns were washed with 50 µL loading buffer and the phosphorylated peptides were eluted with 25 µL 5% ammonia directly into 10 µL 50% formic acid. Samples were lyophilized in a vacuum concentrator and stored at -80°C until analysis by LC-MS/MS.  Reversed-phase high pH (HpH) fractionation of the MM digests were performed on the Bravo AssayMAP system using the Fractionation v1.0 protocol. The pH of the digested samples were adjusted to 10 with 200 mM ammonium formate. RPS cartridges (Agilent, 5 µL bed volume) were primed with 100 µL 90% ACN and equilibrated with 70 µL 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) at a flow rate of 10 µL/min. Samples were loaded at 5 µL/min followed by an internal cartridge wash with 20 mM ammonium formate at 10 µL/min. Elution was performed in six steps with increasing concentrations of ACN in ammonium formate: 4% (F1), 10% (F2), 15% (F3), 20% (F4), 25% (F5) and 80% (F6); 30 µL was eluted into 50 µL of pre-existing buffer containing 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA. The flow through (FT) was collected, processed on C18 cartridges and analyzed as an additional fraction.  LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Thermo Easy-nLC 1000 HPLC coupled on-line to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) or on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Peptides were loaded onto a trap column (Acclaim1 PepMap 100 pre-column, 75 µm, 2 cm, C18, 3 mm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific, San José, CA) and then separated on an analytical column (EASY-Spray column, 25 cm, 75 µm i.d., PepMap RSLC C18, 2 mm, 100Å, Thermo Scientific, San José, CA) using a 120 min ACN gradient in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nL/min and a column temperature of 45°C. Settings on the Q Exactive mass spectrometer were as follows: data-dependent analysis (DDA) selection of the 10 most intense ions for fragmentation, full MS scans at m/z 375-1,750 with a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 200, target AGC value of 3×106 and an injection time (IT) of 60 ms, fragmentation in the HCD collision cell with an NCE of 25 and MS/MS spectra acquisition in the Orbitrap analyzer at a resolution of 35,000 (at m/z 200) with a maximum IT of 120 ms and dynamic exclusion of 30 s. Settings on the Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer were as follows: DDA selection of the 15 most intense ions for fragmentation, full MS scans at m/z 375-1,750 with a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200, a target AGC value of 3×106 and IT of 100 ms, fragmentation in HCD collision cell with an NCE of 25 and MS/MS spectra acquisition in the Orbitrap analyzer at a resolution of 60,000 (at m/z 200) with a maximum IT of 120 ms and dynamic exclusion of 30 s.	Raw files were processed with Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Scientific). The search was performed against the Homo sapiens UniProt revised database with the Sequest HT search engine. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification and methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications; peptide mass tolerance for the precursor ions and MS/MS spectra were 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. A maximum of two missed cleavage sites were accepted. The ptmRS algorithm was used to score phosphorylation sites with a site probability threshold >75. Filtering was performed at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) for both peptides and proteins. For statistical analyses, label-free quantification (LFQ) data was log2-transformed and normalized to column median as standard methods. Analyses such as Pearson correlation, ANOVA and clustering were performed using the Perseus software.
