Investigation Title	The proteome of localized prostate cancer, part 1
Experiment Description	Proteome characterization of gland confined prostate tumors and non-malignant prostate tissue. Whole cell protein extracts were purified from FFPE radical prostatectomy specimens for a total of 28 tumor samples and 8 adjacent non-malignant prostate tissues. Associated ProteomeXchange identifiers: PXD003452, PXD003515, PXD004132, PXD003615, PXD003636, PXD004159.

Protocol Description	Protein extracts of SILAC (heavy Arg10, Lys8) labeled LNCaP, PC-3, 22rv1 and WPMY-1 cells lines of prostatic origin were mixed in a 27:27:27:19 ratio and used as spike-in standard. Whole protein extracts were purified from FFPE specimens as previously described [Ostasiewicz et al 2010. Journal of proteome research]. 25 to 40 micro-g of protein was mixed in equimolar amounts with the isotopicaly labeled protein standard[Geiger et al 2010. Nature Methods] and trypsin digested following the Filter-Aid Sample Preparation (FASP) methodology[Ostasiewicz et al 2010. Journal of proteome research]. 40 micro-g from the resulting tryptic peptides were fractionated by Strong Anion Exchange chromatography (SAX) into six fractions to reduce sample complexity and maximize depth of proteome coverage [Ostasiewicz et al 2010. Journal of proteome research]. Each fraction was then analyzed by LC-MS/MS on the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo). Peptides were separated using a 4h gradient of water:acetonitrile, on a 30 cm C18 column. MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap with 70,000 resolution. MS/MS spectra were acquired in data-dependent mode, after Higher Energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) fragmentation, at a resolution of 17,500[Olsen et al 2009. Molecular & cellular proteomics].	Mass spectrometric raw data were analyzed in the MaxQuant environment, version 1.3.7.1 with the integrated Andromeda searching engine and false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off for peptide identification of 0.1. Proteins were identified by searching MS/MS data against the human proteome sequences from UniProt (UniprotKB, 2012). Normalized light (tissue) to heavy (SILAC standard) intensity ratios were averaged for tumor and control samples
