Investigation Title	Global quantitative analysis of the human brain proteome in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease
Experiment Description	Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) often have overlap in brain neuropathology and clinical presentation suggesting that these two diseases share common underlying mechanisms. Currently, the molecular events linking AD and PD are incompletely understood.  Utilizing 10-plex Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) assays and MultiNotch MS3 mass spectrometry, we performed an unbiased quantitative proteomic analysis of post-mortem human brain tissues (n=80) from four different groups defined as healthy controls, AD, PD, and co-morbid AD/PD cases across two brain regions (frontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus). In total, we identified 11,840 protein groups representing 10,230 gene symbols, which map to ~65% of the protein coding genes in brain. The utility of including two reference standards in each TMT 10-plex assay to assess intra-batch and inter-batch variance is also described. Ultimately, this comprehensive human brain proteomic dataset serves as a valuable resource for various research endeavors including, but not limited to, the identification of protein signatures and neuro-centric signaling pathways that are common or distinct in AD and PD.

Protocol Description	Brain Tissue Homogenization and Protein Digestion---Procedures for tissue homogenization were performed essentially as described23. In total, 40 samples across four pathological groups (n=10 per control, PD, AD and AD/PD groupings) were collected from both brain regions (frontal cortex and anterior cingulate); 31 of these cases had matched tissues across brain regions (Data citation 1). Approximately 100mg (wet tissue weight) of brain tissue was homogenize in 8 M urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaHPO4, pH 8.5) with HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher, Cat# 78440) using a Bullet Blender. Each sample tube (Rino, NextAdvance) was supplemented with ~100 µL of stainless steel beads (0.9 to 2.0 mm blend, NextAdvance) and 500 µL of lysis buffer.  Tissues were added immediately after excision and samples were then placed into the bullet blender (in 4°C cold room).  The samples were homogenized for 2 full 5 min cycles and the lysates were transferred to new Eppendorf Lobind tubes.  Each sample was then sonicated for 3 cycles consisting of 5 seconds of active sonication at 30% amplitude followed by 15 seconds on ice. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 15000 g and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Protein concentration was then determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Prior to further processing, protein integrity and concentration accuracy was assessed by 1 dimensional SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Figure 1).  For protein digestion, 100 µg of each sample was aliquoted and balanced with additional lysis buffer. Samples were reduced with 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by 5 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) alkylation in dark for another 30 min. Samples were then diluted 8 folds with 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) at 1:100 (w/w) was added and digestion was allowed to proceed overnight. Trypsin (Promega) was then added at 1:50 (w/w) and digestion was carried out for another 12 hours. The peptide solution was then acidified to a final concentration of 1% formic acid (FA) and 0.1% triflouroacetic acid (TFA) and desalted with a Sep-Pak C18 column (Water). Each Sep-Pak column was activated with 1 mL of methanol, washed with 1 mL of 80% acetonitrile, and equilibrated with 2 x 1 mL 0.1 % TFA.  The samples were then loaded and each column was washed with 2 x 1 mL 0.1% TFA.  Elution was performed with 2 - 400 µL rounds of 50% acetonitrile. Tandem mass tag (TMT) peptide labeling ---- An aliquot equivalent to 20 µg was taken from each sample and combined to make a global internal standard (GIS) per brain region. All peptides mixtures were dried down using a speedVac. For each tissue region, 5 batches of 10-plex TMT kits (ThermoFisher, Cat# 90111) were used to label the 40 samples and 10 GIS mixtures. Samples arrangement were shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. In each batch, 2 GIS mixtures were labeled with TMT channels 126 and 131 while the 8 middle TMT channels were used to label 2 samples from each disease state. Labeling was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, each sample (80 µg of peptides each) was resuspended in 100 µL of 100 mM TEAB buffer. The TMT labeling reagents were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature and 41 µL anhydrous acetonitrile was added to each reagent channel and softly vortexed for 5 minutes. Peptide suspensions were transferred to corresponding TMT channel reagent and incubated 1h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 8 ul of 5% hydroxylamine. To ensure complete labeling select channels from each batch were analyzed by LC-MS/MS according to previously published methods38. All 10 channels were then combined and the mixture was dried by vacuum to ~ 500 µL. Sep-Pak desalting was performed and the elution was dried to completeness.   ERLIC offline fractionation ---- Dried samples were resuspended in 100 µL of ERLIC buffer A (90% acetonitrile with 0.1% acetic acid) and loaded onto a PolyWAX LP column (20 cm by 3.2 mm packed with 300Å 5 µm beads (PolyLC Inc) as reported previously34. An Agilent 1100 HPLC system consisting of a degasser, a binary pump, an autosampler, a microflow UV detector, and a fraction collector was used to carry out the fractionation. The gradient was from 0 to 50% ERLIC buffer B (30% ACN with 0.1% FA) over 45 minutes. A total of 44 fractions were collected and then combined to a total of 21 fractions.  Fractions 1 to 20 consisted of alternating combinations (1 and 21, 2 and 22, etc.) and fraction 21 consisted of the last fractions (41 to 44).	Protein Identification and Quantification---- Raw data files from Orbitrap Fusion were processed using Proteome Discover (version 2.1). MS/MS spectra were searched against the UniProt Human proteome database (90,300 total sequences). The respective FASTA database is deposited in the on the Synapse web portal (see data records). Sequest parameters were specified as: trypsin enzyme, two missed cleavages allowed, minimum peptide length of 6, TMT tags on lysine residues and peptide N-termini (+ 229.162932 Da) and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+ 57.02146 Da) as fixed modifications, oxidation of methionine residues (+ 15.99492 Da) and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (+0.984 Da) as a variable modification, precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 daltons. Peptide spectral match error rates were determined using the target-decoy strategy coupled to Percolator modeling of true and false matches. Reporter ions were quantified from MS3 scans using an integration tolerance of 20 ppm with the most confident centroid setting. An MS2 spectral assignment false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1% was achieved by applying the target-decoy strategy. Following spectral assignment, peptides were assembled into proteins and proteins and were further filtered based on the combined probabilities of their constituent peptides to a final FDR of 1%. In cases of redundancy, shared peptides were assigned to the protein sequence with the most matching peptides, thus adhering to principles of parsimony.
